      "2024 Financial Highlights \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, revenue increased by 12% to $11.1 billion compared to 2023, primarily due to a 10% increase in Nights and Experiences Booked of 43.3 million combined with higher Average Daily Rate (&#8220;ADR&#8221;) driving a 12% increase in Gross Booking Value of $8.5 billion. The growth in GBV and revenue demonstrated continued strong travel demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, net income decreased by 45% to $2.6 billion, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the release of the majority of our valuation allowance on U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets of $2.9 billion in 2023, and the recognition of deferred tax expense related to the utilization of some of those assets in 2024 (see Note 14, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). This was partially offset due to a decrease in withholding taxes, associated fees, and penalties and interest expense due to a withholding tax settlement related to Italy of $770 million, $196 million and $64 million respectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 11% to $4.0 billion in 2024 demonstrating the continued strength of our business, growth in revenue and discipline in managing our cost structure. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our net cash provided by operating activities was $4.5 billion in 2024, compared to $3.9 billion, in the prior year. We generated Free Cash Flow 1 of $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $3.8 billion, in the prior year. \n",

      "During 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 24.5 million shares of Class A common stock for $3.4 billion. As of December 31, 2024, we completed the repurchases under the August 2, 2022 share repurchase program and had $3.3 billion available for repurchase of Class A common stock under the May 9, 2023 share repurchase program. \n",

      "Inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the United States and the global economy, such as tariffs, foreign currency fluctuations, as well as wars and other geopolitical conflicts, have contributed to an increasingly complex business environment. As a result, our future operational results may be subject to volatility. Additionally, health-related events, political instability, acts of terrorism, and natural disasters, are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future. \n",

Accordingly, we believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their U.S. GAAP results. \n",

      "Nights and Experiences Booked \n",
      "\n",
      "Nights and Experiences Booked is a key measure of the scale of our platform, which in turn drives our financial performance. Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that period. For example, a booking made on February 15 would be reflected in Nights and Experiences Booked for our quarter ended March 31. If, in the example, the booking was canceled on May 15, Nights and Experiences Booked would be reduced by the cancellation for our quarter ended June 30. A night can include one or more guests and can be for a listing with one or more bedrooms. Nights and Experiences Booked grows as we attract new customers to our platform and as repeat guests increase their activity on our platform. A seat is booked for each participant in an experience. Substantially all of the bookings on our platform to date have come from nights. We believe Nights and Experiences Booked is a key business metric to help investors and others understand and evaluate our results of operations in the same manner as our management team, as it represents a single unit of transaction on our platform. \n",

The timing of recording GBV and any related cancellations is similar to that described in the subsection titled &#8220;&#8212; Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures &#8212; Nights and Experiences Booked&#8221; above. Revenue from the booking is recognized upon check-in; accordingly, GBV is a leading indicator of revenue. The entire amount of a booking is reflected in GBV during the quarter in which booking occurs, whether the guest pays the entire amount of the booking upfront or elects to use our Pay Less Upfront program. Growth in GBV reflects our ability to attract and retain customers and reflects growth in Nights and Experiences Booked. \n",

Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and net income margin as well as our other U.S. GAAP results. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities and net cash provided by operating activities margin.

In addition to normal working capital requirements, we anticipate that our short- and long-term cash requirements will include share repurchases, introduction of new products and offerings, timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, debt repayments, and expansion of sales and marketing activities. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, headcount, and ability to attract and retain customers on our platform. Additionally, we may in the future raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our strategic initiatives. On a long-term basis, we would rely on either our access to the capital markets or our credit facility for any long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows and cash on hand. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and/or debt, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the accounting estimates listed below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. \n",

      "In jurisdictions where we do not collect and remit lodging taxes, the responsibility for collecting and remitting these taxes, if applicable, generally rests with hosts. Airbnb is also subject to other non-income taxes primarily arising from transactions with our customers such as transactional taxes (sales, value-added, business, digital service, and similar taxes) where there may be significant uncertainty as to how the taxes apply to our platform, as well as uncertainty on the applicability of withholding taxes on certain payments made to hosts. We estimate liabilities for a certain number of jurisdictions with respect to federal, state, city, and local taxes related to lodging and other non-income taxes where we believe it is probable that Airbnb could be held liable, or, in the case of lodging taxes, jointly and severally liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes, and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. Changes to these liabilities are recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. \n",

      "Evaluating potential outcomes for lodging and other non-income taxes is inherently uncertain and requires us to utilize various judgments, assumptions, and estimates in determining our liability reserves. A variety of factors could affect our potential obligation for collecting and remitting such taxes, which include, but are not limited to, whether we determine, or any tax authority asserts, that we have a responsibility to collect lodging or other non-income and related taxes on either historic or future transactions; the introduction of new ordinances and taxes which subject our operations to such taxes; or the ultimate resolution of any historic claims that may be settled. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of lodging and other non-income taxes may be greater or less than reserve amounts we have established. See Note 13, \n",

      "\n",
      "We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and evaluating the impact of tax law changes, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. \n",
      "\n",
      "In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets across our operating jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Our actual and forecasted income (loss) before provision is subject to change due to economic, political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to recognize our net deferred tax assets. \n",
      "\n",
      "As of December 31, 2024, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets are realizable, except for California research and development credits, capital loss carryovers, and certain losses subject to dual consolidated loss rules. We maintain a valuation allowance for California research and development credits due to uncertainty about their realizability, as they have not met the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; criteria. Changes in valuation allowance during interim periods are reflected in the annual effective tax rate, with any releases based on future taxable income recorded as discrete tax benefits. In 2023, we released $2.9 billion of our valuation allowance and will continue to review the need for such allowances quarterly. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for (benefit from) income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. \n",

      "In 2024, revenue increased by 12% to $11.1 billion compared to 2023, primarily due to a 10% increase in Nights and Experiences Booked of 43.3 million combined with higher Average Daily Rate (&#8220;ADR&#8221;) driving a 12% increase in Gross Booking Value of $8.5 billion. The growth in GBV and revenue demonstrated continued strong travel demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, net income decreased by 45% to $2.6 billion, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the release of the majority of our valuation allowance on U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets of $2.9 billion in 2023, and the recognition of deferred tax expense related to the utilization of some of those assets in 2024 (see Note 14, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). This was partially offset due to a decrease in withholding taxes, associated fees, and penalties and interest expense due to a withholding tax settlement related to Italy of $770 million, $196 million and $64 million respectively. \n",

      "Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 11% to $4.0 billion in 2024 demonstrating the continued strength of our business, growth in revenue and discipline in managing our cost structure. \n",

Accordingly, we believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their U.S. GAAP results. \n",

For example, a booking made on February 15 would be reflected in Nights and Experiences Booked for our quarter ended March 31. If, in the example, the booking was canceled on May 15, Nights and Experiences Booked would be reduced by the cancellation for our quarter ended June 30. A night can include one or more guests and can be for a listing with one or more bedrooms. Nights and Experiences Booked grows as we attract new customers to our platform and as repeat guests increase their activity on our platform. A seat is booked for each participant in an experience. Substantially all of the bookings on our platform to date have come from nights.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and are not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and net income margin as well as our other U.S. GAAP results. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities and net cash provided by operating activities margin.

      "Net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 was $4.5 billion, which was primarily due to income from operations of $2.6 billion and interest income of $818 million, adjusted for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 billion. \n",

      "Net Cash Used in Investing Activities \n",

      "Net Cash Used in Financing Activities \n",
      "\n",
      "Net cash used in financing activities in 2024 was $3.6 billion, primarily due to share repurchases of $3.4 billion, and an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of $630 million, partially offset by the increase in funds payable and amounts payable to customers of $320 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "Effect of Exchange Rates \n",
      "\n",
      "During 2024, we recorded a reduction of $237 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate changes on cash balances can serve as a natural hedge for the effect of exchange rates on our liabilities to our hosts and guests. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on our consolidated statements of cash flows relates to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of customers, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries. \n",

      "We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our short and long-term cash requirements. As such, we believe that the cash flows generated from operating activities will meet our anticipated cash requirements in the short-term. In addition to normal working capital requirements, we anticipate that our short- and long-term cash requirements will include share repurchases, introduction of new products and offerings, timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, debt repayments, and expansion of sales and marketing activities. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, headcount, and ability to attract and retain customers on our platform. Additionally, we may in the future raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our strategic initiatives. On a long-term basis, we would rely on either our access to the capital markets or our credit facility for any long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows and cash on hand. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and/or debt, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item IA of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the market risks identified in the section titled \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" in Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n",

      "Critical Accounting Estimates \n",
      "\n",
      "Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. \n",
      "\n",
      "We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the accounting estimates listed below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. \n",

      "Lodging Tax Obligations and Other Non-Income Tax Matters \n",
      "\n",
      "In jurisdictions where we do not collect and remit lodging taxes, the responsibility for collecting and remitting these taxes, if applicable, generally rests with hosts. Airbnb is also subject to other non-income taxes primarily arising from transactions with our customers such as transactional taxes (sales, value-added, business, digital service, and similar taxes) where there may be significant uncertainty as to how the taxes apply to our platform, as well as uncertainty on the applicability of withholding taxes on certain payments made to hosts. We estimate liabilities for a certain number of jurisdictions with respect to federal, state, city, and local taxes related to lodging and other non-income taxes where we believe it is probable that Airbnb could be held liable, or, in the case of lodging taxes, jointly and severally liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes, and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. Changes to these liabilities are recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluating potential outcomes for lodging and other non-income taxes is inherently uncertain and requires us to utilize various judgments, assumptions, and estimates in determining our liability reserves. A variety of factors could affect our potential obligation for collecting and remitting such taxes, which include, but are not limited to, whether we determine, or any tax authority asserts, that we have a responsibility to collect lodging or other non-income and related taxes on either historic or future transactions; the introduction of new ordinances and taxes which subject our operations to such taxes; or the ultimate resolution of any historic claims that may be settled. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of lodging and other non-income taxes may be greater or less than reserve amounts we have established. See Note 13, \n",

      "Income Taxes \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and evaluating the impact of tax law changes, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. \n",
      "\n",
      "In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets across our operating jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Our actual and forecasted income (loss) before provision is subject to change due to economic, political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to recognize our net deferred tax assets. \n",
      "\n",
      "As of December 31, 2024, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets are realizable, except for California research and development credits, capital loss carryovers, and certain losses subject to dual consolidated loss rules. We maintain a valuation allowance for California research and development credits due to uncertainty about their realizability, as they have not met the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; criteria. Changes in valuation allowance during interim periods are reflected in the annual effective tax rate, with any releases based on future taxable income recorded as discrete tax benefits. In 2023, we released $2.9 billion of our valuation allowance and will continue to review the need for such allowances quarterly. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for (benefit from) income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. \n",

      "2024 Financial Highlights \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, revenue increased by 12% to $11.1 billion compared to 2023, primarily due to a 10% increase in Nights and Experiences Booked of 43.3 million combined with higher Average Daily Rate (&#8220;ADR&#8221;) driving a 12% increase in Gross Booking Value of $8.5 billion. The growth in GBV and revenue demonstrated continued strong travel demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, net income decreased by 45% to $2.6 billion, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the release of the majority of our valuation allowance on U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets of $2.9 billion in 2023, and the recognition of deferred tax expense related to the utilization of some of those assets in 2024 (see Note 14, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). This was partially offset due to a decrease in withholding taxes, associated fees, and penalties and interest expense due to a withholding tax settlement related to Italy of $770 million, $196 million and $64 million respectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 11% to $4.0 billion in 2024 demonstrating the continued strength of our business, growth in revenue and discipline in managing our cost structure. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our net cash provided by operating activities was $4.5 billion in 2024, compared to $3.9 billion, in the prior year. We generated Free Cash Flow 1 of $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $3.8 billion, in the prior year. \n",
      "\n",
      "During 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 24.5 million shares of Class A common stock for $3.4 billion. As of December 31, 2024, we completed the repurchases under the August 2, 2022 share repurchase program and had $3.3 billion available for repurchase of Class A common stock under the May 9, 2023 share repurchase program. \n",
      "\n",
      "Trends \n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the United States and the global economy, such as tariffs, foreign currency fluctuations, as well as wars and other geopolitical conflicts, have contributed to an increasingly complex business environment. As a result, our future operational results may be subject to volatility. Additionally, health-related events, political instability, acts of terrorism, and natural disasters, are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future. \n",

      "Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n",

Accordingly, we believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their U.S. GAAP results. \n",

      "Nights and Experiences Booked \n",
      "\n",
      "Nights and Experiences Booked is a key measure of the scale of our platform, which in turn drives our financial performance. Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that period. For example, a booking made on February 15 would be reflected in Nights and Experiences Booked for our quarter ended March 31. If, in the example, the booking was canceled on May 15, Nights and Experiences Booked would be reduced by the cancellation for our quarter ended June 30. A night can include one or more guests and can be for a listing with one or more bedrooms. Nights and Experiences Booked grows as we attract new customers to our platform and as repeat guests increase their activity on our platform. A seat is booked for each participant in an experience. Substantially all of the bookings on our platform to date have come from nights. We believe Nights and Experiences Booked is a key business metric to help investors and others understand and evaluate our results of operations in the same manner as our management team, as it represents a single unit of transaction on our platform. \n",

The timing of recording GBV and any related cancellations is similar to that described in the subsection titled &#8220;&#8212; Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures &#8212; Nights and Experiences Booked&#8221; above. Revenue from the booking is recognized upon check-in; accordingly, GBV is a leading indicator of revenue. The entire amount of a booking is reflected in GBV during the quarter in which booking occurs, whether the guest pays the entire amount of the booking upfront or elects to use our Pay Less Upfront program. Growth in GBV reflects our ability to attract and retain customers and reflects growth in Nights and Experiences Booked. \n",

Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and net income margin as well as our other U.S. GAAP results. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities and net cash provided by operating activities margin.

In December of 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the OECD&#8217;s global minimum tax rate of 15%. The OECD issued Pillar Two model rules and continues to release guidance on these rules. The inclusive framework calls for tax law changes by participating countries to take effect in 2024 and 2025. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax. We considered the applicable tax law changes on Pillar Two implementation in the relevant countries, and concluded there was no material impact to our tax provision for 2024.

These amounts do not include funds of $5.9 billion as of December 31, 2024, that we held for bookings in advance of guests completing check-ins that we record separately on our consolidated balance sheet in funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers with a corresponding liability in funds payable and amounts payable to customers. \n",

      "During 2024, we recorded a reduction of $237 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate changes on cash balances can serve as a natural hedge for the effect of exchange rates on our liabilities to our hosts and guests. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on our consolidated statements of cash flows relates to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of customers, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries. \n",

      "We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our short and long-term cash requirements. As such, we believe that the cash flows generated from operating activities will meet our anticipated cash requirements in the short-term. In addition to normal working capital requirements, we anticipate that our short- and long-term cash requirements will include share repurchases, introduction of new products and offerings, timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, debt repayments, and expansion of sales and marketing activities. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, headcount, and ability to attract and retain customers on our platform. Additionally, we may in the future raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our strategic initiatives. On a long-term basis, we would rely on either our access to the capital markets or our credit facility for any long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows and cash on hand. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and/or debt, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item IA of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the market risks identified in the section titled \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" in Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n",

      "Critical Accounting Estimates \n",
      "\n",
      "Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions. \n",

      "We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe the accounting estimates listed below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. \n",

      "Lodging Tax Obligations and Other Non-Income Tax Matters \n",
      "\n",
      "In jurisdictions where we do not collect and remit lodging taxes, the responsibility for collecting and remitting these taxes, if applicable, generally rests with hosts. Airbnb is also subject to other non-income taxes primarily arising from transactions with our customers such as transactional taxes (sales, value-added, business, digital service, and similar taxes) where there may be significant uncertainty as to how the taxes apply to our platform, as well as uncertainty on the applicability of withholding taxes on certain payments made to hosts. We estimate liabilities for a certain number of jurisdictions with respect to federal, state, city, and local taxes related to lodging and other non-income taxes where we believe it is probable that Airbnb could be held liable, or, in the case of lodging taxes, jointly and severally liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes, and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. Changes to these liabilities are recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluating potential outcomes for lodging and other non-income taxes is inherently uncertain and requires us to utilize various judgments, assumptions, and estimates in determining our liability reserves. A variety of factors could affect our potential obligation for collecting and remitting such taxes, which include, but are not limited to, whether we determine, or any tax authority asserts, that we have a responsibility to collect lodging or other non-income and related taxes on either historic or future transactions; the introduction of new ordinances and taxes which subject our operations to such taxes; or the ultimate resolution of any historic claims that may be settled. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of lodging and other non-income taxes may be greater or less than reserve amounts we have established. See Note 13, \n",

      "Income Taxes \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and evaluating the impact of tax law changes, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. \n",
      "\n",
      "In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets across our operating jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Our actual and forecasted income (loss) before provision is subject to change due to economic, political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to recognize our net deferred tax assets. \n",
      "\n",
      "As of December 31, 2024, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets are realizable, except for California research and development credits, capital loss carryovers, and certain losses subject to dual consolidated loss rules. We maintain a valuation allowance for California research and development credits due to uncertainty about their realizability, as they have not met the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; criteria. Changes in valuation allowance during interim periods are reflected in the annual effective tax rate, with any releases based on future taxable income recorded as discrete tax benefits. In 2023, we released $2.9 billion of our valuation allowance and will continue to review the need for such allowances quarterly. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for (benefit from) income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. \n",

      "\n",
      "We are a community based on connection and belonging&#8212;a community that was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 5 million Hosts who have welcomed over 1.5 billion guest arrivals in almost every country and region across the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have five stakeholders and we have designed our Company with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve Hosts, guests, and the communities in which they live.

      "2023 Financial Highlights \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2023, revenue increased by 18% to $9.9 billion compared to 2022, primarily due to a 14% increase in Nights and Experiences Booked of 54.5 million combined with higher average daily rates driving a 16% increase in Gross Booking Value of $10.0 billion. The growth in revenue demonstrated continued strong travel demand. On a constant-currency basis, revenue increased 17% in 2023 compared to 2022. \n",
      "\n",
      "Net income in 2023 increased by 153% to $4.8 billion, compared to the prior year, driven by our revenue growth, increased interest income, discipline in managing our cost structure, and the release of a portion of our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $2.9 billion (see Note 14, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in business and operational taxes of $991 million, the majority of which was non-recurring. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 26% to $3.7 billion in 2023 demonstrating the continued strength of our business, a modest increase in ADR, and discipline in managing our cost structure. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our net cash provided by operating activities was $3.9 billion in 2023, compared to $3.4 billion, in the prior year. We generated Free Cash Flow 1 of $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $3.4 billion, in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by growth in revenue, unearned fees and net income. \n",
      "\n",
      "During 2023, we repurchased an aggregate of 17.9 million shares of Class A common stock for $2.3 billion, through two share repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2023, we had $750 million available to repurchase shares of Class A common stock under our share repurchase program. \n",
      "\n",
      "Trends \n",
      "\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic, and measures to contain the virus, including government travel restrictions and quarantine orders, had an unprecedented impact on the global travel industry and materially and adversely affected our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In May 2023, the World Health Organization formally declared an end to the COVID-19 global health emergency. While countries around the world are generally open for international travel, it remains difficult to predict with any certainty the impact any future new strains or variants of the virus may have on the travel industry and, in particular, our business. \n",
      "\n",
      "More recently, inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the United States and the global economy, such as rising interest rates, and foreign currency fluctuations, as well as evolving geopolitical conflicts, have contributed to an increasingly complex business environment. As a result, our future operational results may be subject to volatility. Additionally, further health-related events, political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency values, sustained levels of increased inflation, sovereign debt issues, and natural disasters, are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these factors, we have witnessed a healthy recovery of travel demand, following the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",

We believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their U.S. GAAP results. \n",

Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that period. For example, a booking made on February 15 would be reflected in Nights and Experiences Booked for our quarter ended March 31.

Revenue from the booking is recognized upon check-in; accordingly, GBV is a leading indicator of revenue. The entire amount of a booking is reflected in GBV during the quarter in which booking occurs, whether the guest pays the entire amount of the booking upfront or elects to use our Pay Less Upfront program. Growth in GBV reflects our ability to attract and retain customers and reflects growth in Nights and Experiences Booked. \n",

      "The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of payments of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core results of operations, and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluating performance, and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. \n",

Our Free Cash Flow is impacted by the timing of GBV because we collect our service fees at the time of booking, which is generally before a stay or experience occurs. Funds held on behalf of our customers and amounts payable to our customers do not impact Free Cash Flow, except interest earned on these funds. Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our other U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities.

We use the percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis in addition to the U.S. GAAP presentation helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.

As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.9 billion, which included $1.9 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents consist of checking and interest-bearing accounts and highly-liquid securities with an original maturity of 90 days or less. As of December 31, 2023, short-term investments totaled $3.2 billion. Short-term investments primarily consist of highly-liquid investment grade corporate debt securities, time deposits, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. government and government agency debt securities (&#8220;government bonds&#8221;), and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. These amounts do not include funds of $5.9 billion as of December 31, 2023, that we held for bookings in advance of guests completing check-ins that we record separately on our consolidated balance sheet in funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers with a corresponding liability in funds payable and amounts payable to customers. \n",

Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held outside of the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. However, repatriation of such funds may result in additional tax liabilities.

      "Net cash used in financing activities in 2023 was $2.4 billion, primarily due to share repurchases of $2.3 billion, and an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of $1.2 billion, primarily driven from the taxes paid related to the cashless exercise of stock options, partially offset by the decrease in funds payable and amounts payable to customers of $936 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "Net cash used in financing activities in 2022 was $689 million, primarily due to share repurchases of $1.5 billion under our share repurchase programs, and an increase in the taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards of $607 million, partially offset by an increase in funds payable and amounts payable to customers of $1.3 billion resulting from significantly higher bookings. \n",

      "Effect of Exchange Rates \n",
      "\n",
      "The effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on our consolidated statements of cash flows relates to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of customers, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries. During 2022, we recorded a reduction of $337 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. During 2023, we recorded an increase of $152 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate changes on cash balances can serve as a natural hedge for the effect of exchange rates on our liabilities to our Hosts and guests. \n",
      "\n",
      "We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our short- and long-term cash requirements. As such, we believe that the cash flows generated from operating activities will meet our anticipated cash requirements in the short-term. In addition to normal working capital requirements, we anticipate that our short- and long-term cash requirements will include share repurchases, introduction of new products and offerings, timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, debt repayments, and expansion of sales and marketing activities. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, headcount, and ability to attract and retain customers on our platform. Additionally, we may in the future raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our strategic initiatives. On a long-term basis, we would rely on either our access to the capital markets or our credit facility for any long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows and cash on hand. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and/or debt, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item IA of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the market risks identified in the section titled \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" in Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n",

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n",

      "Lodging Tax Obligations \n",
      "\n",
      "In jurisdictions where we do not collect and remit lodging taxes, the responsibility for collecting and remitting these taxes, if applicable, generally rests with Hosts. We estimate liabilities for a certain number of jurisdictions with respect to state, city, and local taxes related to lodging where we believe it is probable that Airbnb could be held jointly liable with Hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. Changes to these liabilities are recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluating potential outcomes for lodging taxes is inherently uncertain and requires us to utilize various judgments, assumptions, and estimates in determining our reserves. A variety of factors could affect our potential obligation for collecting and remitting such taxes, which include, but are not limited to, whether we determine, or any tax authority asserts, that we have a responsibility to collect lodging and related taxes on either historic or future transactions; the introduction of new ordinances and taxes which subject our operations to such taxes; or the ultimate resolution of any historic claims that may be settled through negotiation. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of lodging taxes may be greater or less than reserve amounts we have established. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies , to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n",
      "\n",
      "Income Taxes \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and evaluating the impact of tax law changes, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. \n",
      "\n",
      "In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we weigh both positive and negative evidence in the various jurisdictions in which we operate related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2023, based on all available positive and negative evidence, having demonstrated sustained profitability which is objective and verifiable, and taking into account anticipated future earnings, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets will be realizable, with the exception of California research and development credits, capital loss carryovers, and certain losses subject to the dual consolidated loss rules. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our California research and development credit deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty regarding realizability of these deferred tax assets as they have not met the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; realization criteria, particularly as we expect research and development tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use the credits in future years. When a change in valuation allowance is recognized during an interim period, the change in valuation allowance resulting from current year income is included in the annual effective tax rate and the release of valuation allowance supported by projections of future taxable income is recorded as a discrete tax benefit in the interim period. We released $2.9 billion of our valuation allowance in 2023 and will continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for (benefit from) income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. \n",

      "As described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have revised previously issued financial statements to correct immaterial misstatements.

      "Overview \n",
      "\n",
      "We are a community based on connection and belonging&#8212;a community that was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed over 1.4 billion guest arrivals to over 100,000 cities and towns in almost every country and region across the globe. Hosts on Airbnb are everyday people who share their worlds to provide guests with the feeling of connection and being at home. We have five stakeholders and we have designed our company with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve Hosts, guests, and the communities in which they live. We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders because their collective success is key for our business to thrive. \n",
      "\n",
      "We operate a global marketplace, where Hosts offer guests stays and experiences on our platform. Our business model relies on the success of Hosts and guests (collectively referred to as &#8220;customers&#8221;) who join our community and generate consistent bookings over time. As Hosts become more successful on our platform and as guests return over time, we benefit from the recurring activity of our community. \n",

      "Initial Public Offering \n",
      "\n",
      "Our initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) was completed on December 14, 2020. Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and for the year then-ended reflect the sale by us of an aggregate of 55,000,000 shares in our IPO, including the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; option to purchase additional shares, at the public offering price of $68.00 per share, for net proceeds to us of approximately $3.7 billion, after underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and the conversion of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into an aggregate of 240,910,588 shares of Class B common stock, including 1,286,694 shares of Class B common stock issuable pursuant to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions relating to our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock. \n",

      "Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and for the year then-ended include stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 billion associated with the vesting of RSUs in connection with our IPO for which the requisite service-based vesting condition was met as of December 31, 2020. The liquidity-based vesting condition for RSUs was satisfied upon the effectiveness of our Registration Statement on Form S-1 on December 9, 2020. \n",

      "2022 Financial Highlights \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, revenue grew by 40% to $8.4 billion compared to 2021, primarily due to a 31% increase in Nights and Experiences Booked of 93.0 million combined with higher average daily rates driving a 35% increase in Gross Booking Value of $16.3 billion. The growth in revenue demonstrated the continued strong travel demand. On a constant-currency basis, revenue increased 46% in 2022 compared to 2021. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ended 2022 with net income of $1.9 billion, an improvement from a net loss of $352.0 million in 2021, and our first profitable year to date. Our net profit margin increased to 23% from a negative 6% in 2021, primarily due to our revenue growth outpacing the growth in our operating expenses and cost management. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased 82% to $2.9 billion in 2022 demonstrating the continued strength of our business and disciplined management of our cost structure. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our net cash provided by operating activities was $3.4 billion in 2022, up from $2.3 billion in 2021, and we generated Free Cash Flow 1 of $3.4 billion. The increase was driven by our revenue growth, net margin expansion, and significant growth in unearned fees. \n",
      "\n",
      "In August 2022, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $2.0 billion of our Class A common stock at management&#8217;s discretion. During 2022, we repurchased and retired 13.8 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Macroeconomic Conditions on our Business \n",
      "\n",
      "As we look forward, we recognize the potential impact of challenging macroeconomic conditions on our business, including inflation and rising interest rates, foreign currency fluctuations, and potential decreased consumer spending. To date, these conditions have had a modest impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition; however, the impact in the future of these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition is uncertain and will depend on future developments that we may not be able to accurately predict. \n",
      "\n",
      "Impact of COVID-19 \n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the outbreak of the novel strain of the coronavirus disease (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) in the first half of 2020, as well as subsequent outbreaks driven by new variants of COVID-19, governments around the world have implemented, and continue to implement, a variety of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, social distancing, shelter-in-place orders, vaccination mandates, or requirements for businesses to confirm employees&#8217; vaccination status, and other restrictions. \n",
      "\n",
      "While COVID-19 still plagues the world, for the year ended December 31, 2022, Gross Booking Value (&#8220;GBV&#8221;) and revenue were $63.2 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, which were both higher compared to the same periods in 2021, 2020, and pre-COVID-19. In 2020 and 2021, we faced lower demand for long distance travel and overall depressed Nights and Experiences Booked compared to pre-COVID-19. However, in 2022, we saw significant growth with Nights and Experiences Booked exceeding pre-COVID-19 levels for the same period. The trends in our recovery continue to vary by region due to a variety of factors, including the emergence of COVID-19 variants, vaccination rates, COVID-19 caseloads, and associated travel restrictions, as well as historical cross-border compared to domestic travel dependence. During 2022, we saw strength in all regions relative to 2021 as well as sequential growth in nights booked in Latin America and Asia Pacific. \n",
      "\n",
      "The extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus that may be resistant to currently approved vaccines, and the continuation of existing or implementation of new government travel restrictions, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions, the timing, availability, and effectiveness of vaccines, and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior in general, and on our business in particular, which may result in a reduction in bookings and an increase in booking cancellations. \n",

Among other changes, the IRA introduced a corporate minimum tax on certain corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over a three-tax year period in excess of $1 billion and an excise tax on certain stock repurchases by certain covered corporations for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022.

      "Nights and Experiences Booked is a key measure of the scale of our platform, which in turn drives our financial performance. Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that period. For example, a booking made on February 15 would be reflected in Nights and Experiences Booked for our quarter ended March 31. If, in the example, the booking were canceled on May 15, Nights and Experiences Booked would be reduced by the cancellation for our quarter ended June 30. A night can include one or more guests and can be for a listing with one or more bedrooms. A seat is booked for each participant in an experience. Substantially all of the bookings on our platform to date have come from nights. We believe Nights and Experiences Booked is a key business metric to help investors and others understand and evaluate our results of operations in the same manner as our management team, as it represents a single unit of transaction on our platform. \n",

Revenue from the booking is recognized upon check-in; accordingly, GBV is a leading indicator of revenue. The entire amount of a booking is reflected in GBV during the quarter in which booking occurs, whether the guest pays the entire amount of the booking upfront or elects to use our Pay Less Upfront program. Growth in GBV reflects our ability to attract and retain customers and reflects growth in Nights and Experiences Booked. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, our GBV was $63.2 billion, a 35% increase from $46.9 billion in 2021. The increase in our GBV was primarily due to an increase in Nights and Experiences Booked. The travel recovery we are experiencing has been dominated by our higher average daily rate (&#8220;ADR&#8221;) regions&#8212;North America and Europe, in particular.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Moreover, we have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluating performance, and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. \n",

Our Free Cash Flow is impacted by the timing of GBV because we collect our service fees at the time of booking, which is generally before a stay or experience occurs. Funds held on behalf of our customers and amounts payable to our customers do not impact Free Cash Flow, except interest earned on these funds. Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.

We use the percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis in addition to the U.S. GAAP presentation helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.

      "Restructuring charges primarily consist of costs associated with a global workforce reduction in May 2020, lease impairments, and costs associated with amendments and terminations of contracts, including commercial agreements with service providers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Stock-Based Compensation \n",
      "\n",
      "We grant stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted stock awards (&#8220;RSAs&#8221;), and restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) to employees, members of our board of directors, and non-employees. In addition, we have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#8220;ESPP&#8221;), which was adopted by our board of directors in December 2020. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interest Income \n",
      "\n",
      "Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts held on behalf of customers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Interest Expense \n",
      "\n",
      "Interest expense consists primarily of interest associated with various indirect tax reserves, amortization of debt issuance and debt discount costs, and the loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repayment of the first and second lien loans in March 2021. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other Income (Expense), Net \n",
      "\n",
      "Other income (expense), net consists primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and balances, the change in fair value of investments and financial instruments, including the warrants issued in connection with a term loan agreement entered into in April 2020, and our share of income or loss from our equity method investments. \n",

      "Our platform generally enables guests to make payments in the currency of their choice to the extent that the currency is supported by Airbnb, which may not match the currency in which the Host elects to be paid. As a result, in those cases, we bear the currency risk of both the guest payment as well as the Host payment due to timing differences in such payments. We enter into derivative contracts to offset a portion of our exposure to the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The effects of these derivative contracts are reflected in other income (expense), net. \n",

      "Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, tax audit developments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains and losses, changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can vary based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have a valuation allowance for our net U.S. deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits, and intangible assets. We expect to maintain these valuation allowances until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized by way of expected future taxable income in the United States. We regularly assess all available evidence, including cumulative historic losses and forecasted earnings. Given our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that sufficient positive evidence may become available in a future period to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of material U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of sustained U.S. profitability that we are able to actually achieve, as well as the amount of tax deductible stock compensation dependent upon our publicly traded share price, foreign currency movements, and macroeconomic conditions, among other factors. \n",

During 2021 and 2022, we recorded reductions of $209.9 million and $337.4 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. The impact of exchange rate changes on cash balances can serve as a natural hedge for the effect of exchange rates on our liabilities to our customers. \n",

      "We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our short- and long-term cash requirements. As such, we believe that the cash flows generated from operating activities will meet our anticipated cash requirements in the short-term. In addition to normal working capital requirements, we anticipate that our short- and long-term cash requirements will include funding capital expenditures, debt repayments, share repurchases, introduction of new products and offerings, timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and expansion of sales and marketing activities. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, headcount, and ability to attract and retain customers on our platform. Additionally, we may in the future raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our strategic initiatives. On a long-term basis, we would rely on either our access to the capital markets or our credit facility for any long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows and cash on hand. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and/or debt, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" in Item 7A. \n",

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions. \n",

      "Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

      "In jurisdictions where we do not collect and remit lodging taxes, the responsibility for collecting and remitting these taxes, if applicable, generally rests with Hosts. We estimate liabilities for a certain number of jurisdictions with respect to state, city, and local taxes related to lodging where we believe it is probable that Airbnb could be held jointly liable with Hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. Changes to these liabilities are recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. \n",

      "Evaluating potential outcomes for lodging taxes is inherently uncertain and requires us to utilize various judgments, assumptions, and estimates in determining our reserves. A variety of factors could affect our potential obligation for collecting and remitting such taxes which include, but are not limited to, whether we determine, or any tax authority asserts, that we have a responsibility to collect lodging and related taxes on either historic or future transactions; the introduction of new ordinances and taxes which subject our operations to such taxes; or the ultimate resolution of any historic claims that may be settled through negotiation. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of lodging taxes may be greater or less than reserve amounts we have established. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies , to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n",

      "In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we weigh both positive and negative evidence in the various jurisdictions in which we operate to determine whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are recoverable. We regularly assess all available evidence, including cumulative historic losses and forecasted earnings. Due to cumulative losses in the U.S. during the prior three years, including tax deductible stock compensation, and based on all available positive and negative evidence, we do not believe it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will be realized as of December 31, 2022. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established in the United States, and no deferred tax assets and related tax benefit have been recognized in the financial statements. However, given our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that sufficient positive evidence may become available in a future period to allow us to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of material U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release is recorded. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of sustained U.S. profitability that we are able to actually achieve, as well as the amount of tax deductible stock compensation dependent upon our publicly traded share price, foreign currency movements, and macroeconomic conditions, among other factors. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for (benefit from) income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. \n",

We believe that the modest recovery in the latter half of 2020 beginning in the second quarter was attributable to the renewed ability and willingness for guests to travel, the resilience of our Hosts, and relative strength of our business model. From December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2020, active listings remained stable at approximately 5.6 million despite the decline in booking activity on our platform due to COVID-19.

      "We are a community based on connection and belonging&#8212;a community that was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed over 1 billion guest arrivals to over 100,000 cities and towns in almost every country and region across the globe. Hosts on Airbnb are everyday people who share their worlds to provide guests with the feeling of connection and being at home. We have five stakeholders and is designed with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve Hosts, guests, and the communities in which they live. We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders because their collective success is key for our business to thrive. \n",

As Hosts become more successful on our platform and as guests return over time, we benefit from the recurring activity of our community. \n",

      "Nights and Experiences Booked is a key measure of the scale of our platform, which in turn drives our financial performance. Nights and Experiences Booked on our platform in a period represents the sum of the total number of nights booked for stays and the total number of seats booked for experiences, net of cancellations and alterations that occurred in that period. For example, a booking made on February 15 would be reflected in Nights and Experiences Booked for our quarter ended March 31. If, in the example, the booking were canceled on May 15, Nights and Experiences Booked would be reduced by the cancellation for our quarter ended June 30. A night can include one or more guests and can be for a listing with one or more bedrooms. A seat is booked for each participant in an experience. Substantially all of the bookings on our platform to date have come from nights.

      "While COVID-19, including new strains of variants, continues to disrupt travel across the world, we have seen continued resiliency in not only our guests' travel behavior, but in our business model and its ability to adapt to the changing needs of our guests. In early 2020, as COVID-19 disrupted travel across the world, Airbnb&#8217;s business declined significantly. However, beginning in the second quarter of 2020, our business model started to rebound even with limited international travel, demonstrating its resilience. People wanted to get out of their homes and yearned to travel, but they did not want to go far or to be in crowded hotel lobbies. Domestic travel quickly rebounded on Airbnb around the world as millions of guests took trips closer to home. Stays of longer than a few days started increasing as work-from-home became work-from-any-home on Airbnb. We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere. Our platform is suited to and has proven adaptable to serve these new ways of traveling. From long weekends to monthly stays, Airbnb allows you to book any home, anywhere, for any duration&#8212;and ultimately, to live anywhere. We believe this trend towards more flexibility will continue to accelerate. In 2021, some of the largest companies in the world announced increased flexibility for employees to work remotely, and we expect more companies to follow their lead. \n",

We experience seasonality in our GBV that is generally consistent with the seasonality of Nights and Experiences Booked. Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highest in the third quarter when we have the most check-ins, which is the point at which we recognize revenue. Seasonal trends in our GBV impact Free Cash Flow for any given quarter. Our costs are relatively fixed across quarters or vary in line with the volume of transactions, and we historically achieve our highest GBV in the first and second quarters of the year with comparatively lower check-ins. As a result, increases in unearned fees make our Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue the highest in the first two quarters of the year. We typically see a slight decline in GBV and a peak in check-ins in the third quarter, which results in a decrease in unearned fees and lower sequential level of Free Cash Flow, and a greater decline in GBV in the fourth quarter, where Free Cash Flow is typically negative.

While we expect this impact on seasonality to continue as long as COVID-19 is impacting travel patterns globally, we have seen the time between when guests make their bookings on our platform and when they expect to complete their stays increase towards a return to pre-COVID-19 levels. Typically, booking lead times sequentially lengthen from the fourth quarter to the first quarter when guests start to book travel for later in the year. Even taking normal seasonal patterns into consideration, we have seen lead times lengthen during 2021. \n",

      "Regulations that permit or limit our Hosts&#8217; ability to provide their listings impact our growth and penetration in certain geographies. In particular, among other regulations governing our short-term rentals, many large cities have placed night caps on short-term rentals of certain types of properties, limited short-term rentals to primary residences, or limited the length of a stay. No single city represented more than 1.0% of our revenue before adjustments for incentives and refunds during the year ended December 31, 2021 or 1.1% of our active listings as of December 31, 2021. An increase in short-term rental regulations could harm our business and negatively impact our financial performance. See the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business may limit the ability or willingness of Hosts to share their spaces over our platform and expose our Hosts or us to significant penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.&#8221; \n",

      "Our revenue consists of service fees, net of incentives and refunds, charged to our customers. We consider both Hosts and guests to be our customers. For stays, service fees, which are charged to customers as a percentage of the value of the booking, excluding taxes, vary based on factors specific to the booking, such as booking value, the duration of the booking, geography, and Host type. For experiences, we only earn a Host fee. Substantially all of our revenue comes from stays booked on our platform. Incentives include our referral programs and marketing promotions to encourage the use of our platform and attract new customers, while our refunds to customers are part of our customer support activities. \n",

      "We experience a difference in timing between when a booking is made and when we recognize revenue, which occurs upon check-in.

Because we act as the merchant of record, we incur all payment processing costs associated with our bookings, and we have chargebacks, which arise from account takeovers and other fraudulent activities. We expect our cost of revenue will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future to the extent that we continue to see growth on our platform. Cost of revenue may vary as a percentage of revenue from year to year based on activity on our platform and may also vary from quarter to quarter as a percentage of revenue based on the seasonality of our business and the difference in the timing of when bookings are made and when we recognize revenue. \n",

We expect that operations and support expense will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future to the extent that we continue to see growth on our platform. We also expect operations and support expense to increase in the near-term as a percentage of revenue, as we had made investments in trust and safety programs and scaled our frontline community support staff in preparation for the travel rebound. We are also investing in the near-term in initiatives to reduce customer contact rates and improve the operational efficiency of our operations and support organization, which we expect will decrease operations and support expense as a percentage of revenue over the longer term. \n",

We expect our sales and marketing expense will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future, and over the long term, we expect it will decline as a percentage of revenue relative to 2019. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was lower in the second half of 2021 than in the first half. This is partially due to the marketing campaign that we began running in February 2021 in advance of the summer travel season. \n",

General and administrative expense also includes certain professional services fees, general corporate and director and officer insurance, allocated costs for facilities and information technology, indirect taxes, including lodging tax reserves for which we may be held jointly liable with Hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes, and bad debt expense. We expect to incur additional general and administrative expense as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Listing Rules of Nasdaq, as well as higher expenses for corporate insurance, director and officer insurance, investor relations, and professional services. Overall, we expect our general and administrative expense will vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future. \n",

As a result, in those cases, we bear the currency risk of both the guest payment as well as the Host payment due to timing differences in such payments. We enter into derivative contracts to offset a portion of our exposure to the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on our transactional balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The effects of these derivative contracts are reflected in other income (expense), net. \n",

      "We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, tax audit developments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains and losses, changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can vary based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. \n",

On a long-term basis, we would rely on either our access to the capital markets or our credit facility for any long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows. \n",

      "In December 2020, upon the completion of our IPO, we received net proceeds of $3.7 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $79.3 million and offering expenses of $9.8 million. We used a portion of these net proceeds to satisfy the tax withholding and remittance obligations of approximately $1.6 billion related to the settlement of our outstanding RSUs in connection with our IPO. \n",

The 2026 Notes were offered and sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;). \n",

      "\n",
      "The initial conversion rate for the 2026 Notes is 3.4645 shares of our Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $288.64 per share of the Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. \n",

Holders of the 2026 Notes who convert their 2026 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 2026 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2026 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased. \n",

The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Class A common stock initially underlying the 2026 Notes sold in the offering. By entering into the Capped Calls, we expect to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2026 Notes is settled in cash, to reduce our cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2026 Notes our common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2026 Notes. The cap price of the Capped Calls will initially be $360.80 per share of Class A common stock, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock of $180.40 per share on March 3, 2021, and is subject to certain customary adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Calls meet the criteria for classification in equity, are not remeasured each reporting period and included as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital within stockholders&#8217; equity. \n",

      "On November 19, 2020, we entered into a five-year secured revolving Credit and Guarantee Agreement, which provides initial commitments from a group of lenders led by Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. of $500.0 million (&#8220;2020 Credit Facility&#8221;). The 2020 Credit Facility provides a $200.0 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit. The 2020 Credit Facility has a commitment fee of 0.15% per annum on any undrawn amounts, payable quarterly in arrears. Interest on borrowings is equal to (i) in the case of LIBOR borrowings, 1.5% plus LIBOR, subject to a floor of 0%, or (ii) in the case of base rate borrowings, 0.5% plus the greatest of (a) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day by Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as its &#8220;prime rate&#8221;, and (c) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.0%, in each case subject to a floor of 1.0%. Outstanding balances may be repaid prior to maturity without penalty. The 2020 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries&#8217; ability to incur debt and liens, undergo fundamental changes, and pay dividends or other distributions, as well as certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2021. No amounts have been drawn on the 2020 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, and outstanding letters of credit totaled $21.4 million and $15.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

      "Net cash used in investing activities in 2021 was $1.4 billion, which was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of $4.9 billion, partially offset by proceeds resulting from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Net cash provided by investing activities in 2020 was $79.6 million, which was primarily provided by proceeds resulting from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, partially offset by cash used to purchase marketable securities of $3.0 billion and property and equipment of $37.4 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cash Provided by Financing Activities \n",
      "\n",
      "Net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 was $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting the proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, net of issuance costs, of $2.0 billion and an increase in funds payable and amounts payable to customers of $1.6 billion, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt and a related prepayment penalty of $2.0 billion and $212.9 million, respectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $2.9 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds of $3.7 billion from the issuance of Class A common stock upon IPO, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, $1.9 billion from the issuance of long-term debt and warrants, net of issuance costs, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 billion for taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and $1.0 billion in funds payable and amounts payable to customers. \n",

      "Effect of Exchange Rates \n",
      "\n",
      "The effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on our consolidated statements of cash flows relates to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of Hosts and guests, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries. During 2021, we recorded a $209.9 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. During 2020 we recorded a $134.1 million increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, respectively, primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate changes on cash balances can serve as a natural hedge for the effect of exchange rates on our liabilities to our Hosts and guests. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that our current available cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to capital markets, will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months and beyond. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, headcount, ability to attract and retain Hosts and guests on our platform, capital expenditures, acquisitions, introduction of new products and offerings, timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and expansion of sales and marketing activities. Additionally, we may in the future raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our strategic initiatives. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and/or debt, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our liquidity is \n",

      "\n",
      "Indemnification Agreements \n",
      "\n",
      "In the ordinary course of business, we include limited indemnification provisions under certain agreements with parties with whom we have commercial relations of varying scope and terms. Under these contracts, we may indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with breach of the agreements, or intellectual property infringement claims made by a third party, including claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to its performance under the subject agreement. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, no significant costs have been incurred, either individually or collectively, in connection with our indemnification provisions. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors, executive officers and certain other employees that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, executive officers, or employees. \n",
      "\n",
      "Contractual Obligations and Commitments \n",
      "\n",
      "We have various contractual obligations and commitments, such as long-term leases, purchase commitments, long-term debt, and other executory contracts, that are disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. See Note 8. Leases , Note 10, Debt , and Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information regarding these commitments. \n",

      "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n",
      "\n",
      "Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue Recognition \n",
      "\n",
      "We generate substantially all of our revenue from facilitating guest stays at accommodations offered by Hosts on the Airbnb platform. We consider both Hosts and guests to be our customers. Our revenue is comprised of service fees from our customers. Our single performance obligation is identified as the facilitation of a stay, which occurs upon the completion of a check-in event. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied upon check-in. \n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue is presented net of certain payments we make to customers as part of our referral programs and marketing promotions, collectively referred to as our incentive programs, and refund activities. The payments are generally in the form of coupon credits to be applied toward future bookings or as cash refunds. We encourage the use of our platform and attract new customers through our incentive programs. Under the referral program, the referring party (&#8220;referrer&#8221;) earns a coupon when the new Host or guest (&#8220;referee&#8221;) completes their first stay on our platform. We record the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the corresponding charge recorded to sales and marketing expense. Any amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the referral service received are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Through marketing promotions, we issue customer coupon credits to encourage the use of our platform. After a customer redeems such incentives, we record a reduction to revenue at the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction. From time to time, we issue refunds to customers in the form of cash or credits to be applied toward a future booking. We reduce the transaction price by the estimated amount of the payments by applying the most likely outcome method based on known facts and circumstances and historical experience. These refunds are recorded as a reduction to revenue. \n",
      "\n",
      "We evaluate whether the cumulative amount of payments made to customers that are not in exchange for a distinct good or service received from a customer exceeds the cumulative revenue earned since inception of the customer relationship. Any cumulative payments in excess of cumulative revenue are presented as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Stock-Based Compensation \n",
      "\n",
      "We have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, and restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) to employees, members of our board of directors, and non-employees. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, exercise price, the expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock. The fair value of stock options is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they occur. \n",
      "\n",
      "The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; Expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; Expected volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; Expected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is zero, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock. \n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected term, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lodging Tax Obligations \n",
      "\n",
      "Some states, cities, and localities in the United States and elsewhere in the world impose transient occupancy or lodging accommodations taxes (&#8220;lodging taxes&#8221;) on the use or occupancy of lodging accommodations or other traveler services. We collect and remit lodging taxes in more than 30,400 jurisdictions on behalf of our Hosts, and lodging taxes are primarily collected in the United States and France. Such lodging taxes are generally remitted to tax jurisdictions within a 30 to 90-day period following the end of each month. \n",
      "\n",
      "In jurisdictions where we do not collect and remit lodging taxes, the responsibility for collecting and remitting these taxes, if applicable, generally rests with Hosts. We estimate liabilities for a certain number of jurisdictions with respect to state, city, and local taxes related to lodging where we believe it is probable that Airbnb could be held jointly liable with Hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. Changes to these liabilities are recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are currently involved in a number of lawsuits brought by certain states and localities involving the payment of lodging taxes. These jurisdictions are asserting that we are liable or jointly liable with Hosts to collect and remit lodging taxes. These lawsuits are in various stages and we continue to vigorously defend these claims. We believe that the statutes at issue impose a lodging tax obligation on the person exercising the taxable privilege of providing accommodations, our Hosts. The ultimate resolution of these lawsuits cannot be determined at this time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluating potential outcomes for lodging taxes is inherently uncertain and requires us to utilize various judgments, assumptions and estimates in determining our reserves. A variety of factors could affect our potential obligation for collecting and remitting such taxes which include, but are not limited to, whether we determine, or any tax authority asserts, that we have a responsibility to collect lodging and related taxes on either historic or future transactions; the introduction of new ordinances and taxes which subject our operations to such taxes; or the ultimate resolution of any historic claims that may be settled through negotiation. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of lodging taxes may be greater or less than reserve amounts we have established. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies , to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n",
      "\n",
      "Income Taxes \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and evaluating the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for (benefit from) income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. \n",
      "\n",
      "The provision for (benefit from) income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities that may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for (benefit from) income taxes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Goodwill and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets \n",
      "\n",
      "Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. We have one reporting unit. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. As a result of the goodwill impairment assessment, management concluded goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2021 and does not believe that its reporting unit is at risk of failing the impairment test since the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value. \n",
      "\n",
      "Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize impairment to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair \n",
      "\n",
      "value. We determine fair value through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Any impairments to right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets, leasehold improvements, or other assets as a result of a sublease, abandonment, or other similar factor are initially recognized when a decision to do so is made and recorded as an operating expense. Similar to other long-lived assets, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For lease assets, such circumstances would include subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated leases or a decision to abandon the use of all or part of an asset. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company recorded $35.8 million and $112.5 million, respectively, of long-lived assets impairment charges within restructuring charges in the consolidated statement of operations. There were no impairments of long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2019. \n",
      "\n",
      "Significant judgment and estimates are required in assessing impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, including identifying whether events or changes in circumstances require an impairment assessment, estimating future cash flows, and determining appropriate discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. \n",

This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. Except as otherwise noted, all references to 2020 refer to the year ended December 31, 2020, references to 2019 refer to the year ended December 31, 2019, and references to 2018 refer to the year ended December 31, 2018. \n",

      "Overview \n",
      "\n",
      "Airbnb is a community based on connection and belonging&#8212;a community that was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to 4 million hosts who have welcomed over 800 million guest arrivals to approximately 100,000 cities in almost every country and region across the globe. Hosts on Airbnb are everyday people who share their worlds to provide guests with the feeling of connection and being at home. Airbnb has five stakeholders and is designed with all of them in mind. Along with employees and shareholders, we serve hosts, guests, and the communities in which they live. We intend to make long-term decisions considering all of our stakeholders because their collective success is key for our business to thrive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our Business Model \n",
      "\n",
      "We operate a global marketplace, where hosts offer guests stays and experiences on our platform. Our business model relies on the success of hosts and guests who join our community and generate consistent bookings over time. As hosts become more successful on our platform and as guests return over time, we benefit from the recurring activity of our community. \n",
      "\n",
      "We experienced rapid growth since our founding through 2019.

      "\n",
      "In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus disease was first reported. Only three months later, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced international, federal, state, and local governments to enforce prohibitions of non-essential activities. The outbreak will have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and has already triggered a period of global economic slowdown, the depth and breadth of which are yet to be determined. \n",
      "\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in global travel restrictions and a corresponding significant reduction in travel. While many industries have been adversely impacted, travel has been disproportionately affected, as governments have implemented travel restrictions and as people have become reluctant to travel irrespective of such restrictions. \n",

      "Prior to the outbreak, we had seen strong year-over-year growth in Nights and Experiences Booked in the first three weeks of 2020. We first saw the impact of COVID-19 in China in the last week of January, which when contained to China, had a minor impact on the entire business. The outbreak spread throughout Asia, and then through Europe, North America, and the rest of the world by the end of the first quarter of 2020. In order to protect our business from these near-term market disruptions and the prospect of a prolonged business impact, we raised $2.0 billion in the form of term loans in April 2020 and took action to dramatically reduce our operating expenses as described below. We believe these incremental funds and our rapid management of expenses, in addition to our existing cash position, has helped and will continue to help us to prudently manage our business through the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
      "\n",
      "As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows remains uncertain. Our financial results for 2020 were materially adversely affected, and we expect that COVID-19 will continue to materially impact our bookings, revenue, and business operations in future periods. While we experienced an increase in GBV and revenue in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2020 as domestic travel rebounded, both were down compared to the same periods in 2019. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the fourth quarter of 2020, another wave of COVID-19 infections emerged. As a result, countries imposed strict lockdowns. Similar to the impact of the initial COVID-19 wave in March 2020, we saw a decrease in bookings in the most affected regions. As a result, while the fourth quarter GBV and revenue were greater than the second quarter, there were greater year-over-year declines in Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV in the fourth quarter of 2020 than in the third quarter of 2020. The extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions, the timing, availability, and effectiveness of vaccines, and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior in general, and on our business in particular. \n",

From December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2020, active listings remained stable at approximately 5.6 million despite the decline in booking activity on our platform due to COVID-19.

      "\n",
      "In response to the spread of COVID-19 and the resulting material decrease in GBV, we undertook an internal review of our cost structure, ultimately making changes to improve the strength of our business in the long term. Specifically, we significantly reduced our fixed and variable costs in 2020, which we believe will result in improved operating leverage as we emerge from COVID-19. In 2020, we rapidly made changes to manage our expenses in a period of material business interruption, which included suspending substantially all discretionary marketing program spend, reducing full-time employee headcount by approximately 25%, and suspending all facilities build-outs and significantly reducing capital expenditures. \n",
      "\n",
      "These headcount reductions and other restructuring actions resulted in charges of $151.4 million for 2020. In conjunction with these actions, we have realigned our organizational priorities to further increase our focus on individual hosts and brand marketing, while pausing our investments in newer areas such as transportation and content and reducing performance marketing. We have done this to sharpen our focus on investments that directly strengthen our community and to increase the efficiency of our operations as the travel industry begins to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe these changes should allow us to more effectively manage our business and improve our financial operating results. \n",

      "Our operations are global, and certain trends in our business, such as Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, revenue, GBV per Night and Experience Booked, and Nights per Booking vary by geography. \n",
      "\n",
      "We measure Nights and Experiences Booked by region based on the location of the listing. As a result of COVID-19, the geographic mix of Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and revenue during 2020 reflected a shift toward North America, which saw the strongest recovery in the second half of the year. For 2020, Nights and Experiences Booked were 75.5 million, or 39% of the total, in North America compared to 67.7 million, or 35%, in EMEA, 27.6 million, or 14%, in Asia Pacific, and 22.4 million, or 12%, in Latin America. For 2020, GBV was $13.2 billion, or 55% of the total, in North America compared to $6.6 billion, or 28%, in EMEA, $2.4 billion, or 10%, in Asia Pacific, and $1.7 billion, or 7%, in Latin America. Similarly, for 2020, revenue was $1.8 billion, or 53% of the total, in North America compared to $1.0 billion, or 30%, in EMEA, $0.3 billion, or 10%, in Asia Pacific, and $0.3 billion, or 7%, in Latin America. \n",
      "\n",
      "We saw an increase in GBV per Night and Experience Booked in 2020 compared to 2019, in part because our geographic mix shifted to these higher GBV per Night and Experience Booked regions. North America saw an increase in GBV per Night and Experience Booked as larger entire homes have been in greater demand. The average nights per booking also increased globally 2020, reflecting demand for longer stays. Specifically, GBV per Night and Experience Booked in 2020 was $174.43 for North America compared to $98.41 for EMEA, $85.83 for Asia Pacific, and $75.74 for Latin America, with a total global GBV per Night and Experience Booked of $123.69. Average nights per booking, excluding experiences, for 2020 were 4.4 nights for each of North America, EMEA, and Latin America and 2.8 nights for Asia Pacific, with a total average of 4.1 nights. We expect that our blended global average nights per booking will fluctuate based on our geographic mix and changes in traveler behaviors. \n",

      "and third quarters have higher Nights and Experiences Booked than the fourth quarter, as guests plan for travel during the peak travel season, which is in the third quarter for North America and EMEA. Our business metrics, including GBV and Adjusted EBITDA, can also be impacted by the timing of holidays and other events. We experience seasonality in our GBV that is generally consistent with the seasonality of Nights and Experiences Booked. Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highest in the third quarter when we have the most check-ins, which is the point at which we recognize revenue. Seasonal trends in our GBV impact Free Cash Flow for any given quarter. Our costs are relatively fixed across quarters or vary in line with the volume of transactions, and we historically achieve our highest GBV in the first and second quarters of the year with comparatively lower check-ins. As a result, increases in unearned fees make our Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue the highest in the first two quarters of the year. We typically see a slight decline in GBV and a peak in check-ins in the third quarter, which results in a decrease in unearned fees and lower sequential level of Free Cash Flow, and a greater decline in GBV in the fourth quarter, where Free Cash Flow is typically negative. As our business matures, other seasonal trends may develop, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme. \n",

      "In 2020, we saw COVID-19 overwhelm the historical patterns of seasonality in our GBV, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow as a result of travel restrictions and changing travel preferences relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this impact on seasonality to continue as long as COVID-19 is impacting travel patterns globally. \n",

No single city represented more than 1.1% of our revenue before adjustments for incentives and refunds during the year ended December 31, 2020 or 1.2% of our active listings as of December 31, 2020. An increase in short-term rental regulations could harm our business and negatively impact our financial performance. See the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business may limit the ability or willingness of hosts to share their spaces over our platform and expose our hosts or us to significant penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.&#8221; \n",

For stays, service fees, which are charged to customers as a percentage of the value of the booking, excluding taxes, vary based on factors specific to the booking, such as booking value, the duration of the booking, geography, and host type. For experiences, we only earn a host fee. Substantially all of our revenue comes from stays booked on our platform. Incentives include our referral programs and marketing promotions to encourage the use of our platform and attract new customers, while our refunds to customers are part of our customer support activities. \n",

      "We experience a difference in timing between when a booking is made and when we recognize revenue, which occurs upon check-in. We record the service fees that we collect from customers prior to check-in on our balance sheet as unearned fees. Revenue is net of incentives and refunds provided to customers totaling $221.5 million, $274.5 million, and $384.2 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, representing 6%, 6%, and 11% of revenue, respectively. The elevated level of incentives and refunds provided to customers during the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to payments made to support hosts impacted by increased guest cancellations and COVID-19 related guest cancellation coupons. \n",

Because we act as the merchant of record, we incur all payment processing costs associated with our bookings, and we have chargebacks, which arise from account takeovers and other fraudulent activities. We expect our cost of revenue will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future to the extent that we continue to see growth on our platform. Cost of revenue may vary as a percentage of revenue from year to year based on activity on our platform and may also vary from quarter to quarter as a percentage of revenue based on the seasonality of our business and the difference in the timing of when bookings are made and when we recognize revenue. \n",

We expect that operations and support expense will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future to the extent that we continue to see growth on our platform. We also expect operations and support to increase in the near-term as a percentage of revenue, as we continue to invest in trust and safety programs. We are also investing in the near-term in initiatives to reduce customer contact rates and improve the operational efficiency of our operations and support organization, which we expect will decrease operations and support expense as a percentage of revenue over the longer term. We incurred additional operations and support expense during 2020, the year in which we completed our IPO, as a result of the stock-based compensation expense associated with our RSUs as described in the subsection titled &#8220;&#8212; Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8212;Stock-Based Compensation&#8212;Restricted Stock Units,&#8221; and anticipate additional stock-based compensation expense going forward. \n",

We expect that sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in the first half of 2021 will be higher than that of the second half.

Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, tax audit developments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains and losses, changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can vary based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss.

In March 2020, driven by COVID-19, we paused our sales and marketing investments in new initiatives and our performance marketing spend. We implemented a marketing strategy that shifted our marketing mix more towards brand marketing spend and away from spending on performance marketing.

Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, headcount, ability to attract and retain hosts and guests on our platform, capital expenditures, acquisitions, introduction of new products and offerings, timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and expansion of sales and marketing activities. Additionally, we may in the future raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue to fund our strategic initiatives. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and&#47;or debt, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

      "Revenue Recognition \n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, which we adopted as of January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis. We generate substantially all of our revenue from facilitating guest stays at accommodations offered by hosts on the Airbnb platform. We consider both hosts and guests to be our customers. Our revenue is comprised of service fees from our customers. Our single performance obligation is identified as the facilitation of a stay, which occurs upon the completion of a check-in event. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied upon check-in. \n",
      "\n",
      "We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether or not we are the principal in the transaction (gross) or whether we arrange for other parties to provide the service to guests and are the agent (net) in the transaction. We determined that we do not control the right to use the accommodations provided by us either before or after completion of our service. Accordingly, we concluded that we are acting in an agent capacity and revenue is presented net reflecting the service fees received from our customers to facilitate a stay. \n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue is presented net of certain payments we make to customers as part of our referral programs and marketing promotions, collectively referred to as our incentive programs, and refund activities. The payments are generally in the form of coupon credits to be applied toward future bookings or as cash refunds. We encourage the use of our platform and attract new customers through our incentive programs. Under the referral program, the referring party (&#8220;referrer&#8221;) earns a coupon when the new host or guest (&#8220;referee&#8221;) completes their first stay on our platform. We record the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the corresponding charge recorded to sales and marketing expense. Any amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the referral service received are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Through marketing promotions, we issue customer coupon credits to encourage the use of our platform. After a customer redeems such incentives, we record a reduction to revenue at the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction. From time to time, we issue refunds to customers in the form of cash or credits to be applied toward a future booking. We reduce the transaction price by the estimated amount of the payments by applying the most likely outcome method based on known facts and circumstances and historical experience. These refunds are recorded as a reduction to revenue. \n",
      "\n",
      "We evaluate whether the cumulative amount of payments made to customers that are not in exchange for a distinct good or service received from a customer exceeds the cumulative revenue earned since inception of the customer relationship. Any cumulative payments in excess of cumulative revenue are presented as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. \n",

      "We have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, and restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) to employees, members of our board of directors, and non-employees. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock. The fair value of stock options is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they occur. \n",

      "These assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock (see the subsection titled &#8220;&#8212; Common Stock Valuations&#8221; below), are estimated as follows&#58; \n",

      "\n",
      "We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award. Prior to our IPO in December 2020, no stock-based compensation expense had been recognized for RSUs with both service-based and liquidity-based vesting conditions because the liquidity-based vesting condition had not been probable of being satisfied. Upon our IPO in December 2020, we recorded a cumulative one-time stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 billion, determined using the grant-date fair values.

      "\n",
      "The income approach estimates enterprise value based on the estimated present value of future cash flows the business is expected to generate over its remaining life. The estimated present value is calculated using a discount rate reflective of the risks associated with an investment in a similar company in a similar industry or having a similar history of revenue growth. The market approach measures the value of a business through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable investments or assets, and in our case, focused on comparing us to a group of our peer companies. In applying this method, valuation multiples are derived from historical operating data of the peer company group. We then apply multiples to our operating data to arrive at a range of indicated values of the company. \n",
      "\n",
      "For each valuation, we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the value of invested capital for both the income approach and market approach. The financial forecast considered our past results and expected future financial performance. The risk associated with achieving this forecast was assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates as the assumptions used are highly subjective and subject to changes as a result of new operating data and economic and other conditions that impact our business. \n",

We collect and remit lodging taxes in more than 29,800 jurisdictions on behalf of our hosts, and lodging taxes are primarily collected in the United States. Such lodging taxes are generally remitted to tax jurisdictions within a 30 to 90-day period following the end of each month. \n",
      "\n",
      "In jurisdictions where we do not collect and remit lodging taxes, the responsibility for collecting and remitting these taxes, if applicable, generally rests with hosts. We estimate liabilities for a certain number of jurisdictions with respect to state, city, and local taxes related to lodging where we believe it is probable that Airbnb could be held jointly liable with hosts for collecting and remitting such taxes and the related amounts can be reasonably estimated. Our accrued obligations related to lodging taxes, including estimated penalties and taxes, totaled $138.4 million and $52.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and changes to this reserve are recorded in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. \n",

      "We are currently involved in a number of lawsuits brought by certain states and localities involving the payment of lodging taxes. These jurisdictions are asserting that we are liable or jointly liable with hosts to collect and remit lodging taxes. These lawsuits are in various stages and we continue to vigorously defend these claims. We believe that the statutes at issue impose a lodging tax obligation on the person exercising the taxable privilege of providing accommodations, our hosts. The ultimate resolution of these lawsuits cannot be determined at this time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluating potential outcomes for lodging taxes is inherently uncertain and requires us to utilize various judgments, assumptions and estimates in determining our reserves. A variety of factors could affect our potential obligation for collecting and remitting such taxes which include, but are not limited to, whether we determine, or any tax authority asserts, that we have a responsibility to collect lodging and related taxes on either historic or future transactions&#59; the introduction of new ordinances and taxes which subject our operations to such taxes&#59; or the ultimate resolution of any historic claims that may be settled through negotiation. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of lodging taxes may be greater or less than reserve amounts we have established. \n",
      "\n",
      "Income Taxes \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and evaluating the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for (benefit from) income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. \n",
      "\n",
      "The provision for (benefit from) income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities that may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for (benefit from) income taxes. \n",

      "Goodwill and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets \n",
      "\n",
      "Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. We have one reporting unit. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. As a result of the goodwill impairment assessment, management concluded goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2020 and does not believe that its reporting unit is at risk of failing the impairment test since the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value. \n",
      "\n",
      "Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize impairment to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. We determine fair value through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Any impairments to right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets, leasehold improvements, or other assets as a result of a sublease, abandonment, or other similar factor are initially recognized when a decision to do so is made and recorded as an operating expense. Similar to other long-lived assets, management tests ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For lease assets, such circumstances would include subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated leases or a decision to abandon the use of all or part of an asset. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $35.8 million of ROU asset impairment charges within restructuring charges in the consolidated statement of operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Significant judgment and estimates are required in assessing impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, including identifying whether events or changes in circumstances require an impairment assessment, estimating future cash flows, and determining appropriate discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. \n",
