      " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our Class A common stock. The following material factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors, and oral statements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Risks Related to Our Business and Operations \n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue and Growth Risks \n",
      "\n",
      "We may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate or effectively manage growth or new opportunities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our future revenue growth depends on the growth of supply and demand for listings on our platform and the development and adoption of new offerings and initiatives. Our business is also affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide as well as trends in the global travel and hospitality industries and the short and long-term accommodation regulatory landscape. A softening of supply or demand for our current or future offerings, whether caused by events outside of our control, challenging macroeconomic and political conditions, changes in host and guest preferences, public health crises such as pandemics, and any of the other factors described in these Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or otherwise, may result in decreased revenue and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we fail to retain or add hosts and guests, if hosts fail to provide high-quality stays and experiences, if our new offerings and initiatives are unsuccessful, or if our community support offerings are inadequate, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business success is heavily reliant on both hosts and guests engaging with our platform. Hosts must maintain and enhance their listings by offering a variety of desirable, competitively priced, and high-quality stays and experiences, while providing exceptional hospitality and timely responses to guest inquiries. These factors are largely outside our direct control, and if hosts fail to meet these expectations, or if they choose to cross-list or list exclusively with competitors, or if we are unable to attract and retain hosts in a cost-effective manner, or at all, our revenue and business operations could be adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our ability to attract and retain guests is crucial and can be impacted by external factors such as pandemics, political instability, climate change, and economic downturns, as well as internal factors like competition, brand perception, and platform usability. Additionally, our brand and reputation are critical to our success, as they influence our ability to attract and retain hosts, guests, and employees. Any negative perceptions or incidents related to safety, security, or quality could harm our public image and business operations. Issues such as unreliable reviews, regulatory scrutiny, or negative media coverage can further damage trust within our community, materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to invest in the development of new offerings and initiatives, including innovations focused on improving our host and guest experiences; however, developing and delivering these new offerings and initiatives increase our expenses and our organizational complexity, and we may experience difficulties in developing and implementing these new offerings and initiatives. Our new offerings and initiatives have a high degree of risk, as they may involve unproven businesses with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience. There can be no assurance that our hosts and guests will adopt or respond positively to such offerings and initiatives, that we will be able to successfully manage the development and delivery of such offerings and initiatives, or that any of these offerings or initiatives will help attract and retain users on our platform and gain sufficient market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset associated expenses or liabilities. If our new offerings and initiatives are not successful, or if we fail to provide a seamless and satisfactory experience for both hosts and guests, or if our host protection programs, including those provided through AirCover for hosts, become ineffective, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, our growth relies on delivering high-quality support to our community, which requires significant investment in staffing, technology, infrastructure, and training. As our global customer base expands, particularly outside of North America and Europe, we face increased pressure to provide efficient, multilingual support. The vast majority of our community support is performed by third-party service providers, and our reliance on third-party service providers necessitates stringent guidance and quality control to maintain satisfactory service levels. Inadequate support or dispute resolution can harm our reputation and affect retention, leading to potential revenue reductions through refunds or coupons. The cost of maintaining robust community support is expected to rise, and efforts to reduce support requests may not offset these costs, materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we are unable to successfully expand our global network or manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are a global platform with hosts in more than 220 countries and regions and over 100,000 cities and towns, and we serve a global guest community. For the year ended December 31, 2024, 58% of our revenue was generated from listings outside of the United States. We expect to continue to make investments to expand our international operations; however, there can be no assurance that our international expansion efforts will be successful or result in revenue growth. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming, and expensive, and requires significant management attention and careful prioritization. As such, any international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to operational, tax, regulatory, and compliance risks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Increased operating expenses, decreased revenue, negative publicity, negative reaction from our hosts and guests and other stakeholders, or other adverse impacts from any of the risks related to our international operations could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on the value of our brand and traffic to our platform to grow revenue, and if we are unable to market our brand and drive traffic cost-effectively, it would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe maintaining and strengthening our brand is crucial for attracting and retaining hosts and guests. We invest significantly in brand marketing across various channels to drive traffic to our platform, but these efforts may not always be cost-effective or successful. Additionally, increased spending by competitors on brand marketing could hinder our ability to grow platform traffic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our marketing strategy includes performance marketing through search engines and social media, as well as paid and unpaid channels like search engine optimization (&#8220;SEO&#8221;). However, rising costs for keywords and changes in search engine algorithms can impact our visibility and increase customer acquisition costs. If we cannot effectively grow traffic without increasing performance marketing spend, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "SEO efforts are vulnerable to changes in search engine algorithms and consumer behavior, which can reduce our platform's prominence. If our listings are less visible, we may need to increase paid marketing, raising costs and affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If consumers become less reliant on search engines for travel searches and instead incorporate AI and machine learning and other channels, we may not be able to optimize for searches on these emerging channels and may risk losing traffic to competitors. Additionally, if major platforms like Google or Apple favor their own services or other partner services, our ability to engage users via mobile app or search could be impacted. \n",
      "\n",
      "As guests compare offerings across multiple sites, our marketing efficiency may decline, necessitating increased expenditures that may not yield additional revenue. Additionally, negative publicity or complaints could harm our reputation, reducing platform usage and requiring further marketing spend to recover traffic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Brand and Reputation Risks \n",
      "\n",
      "Host, guest, or third-party actions that are criminal, violent, inappropriate, dangerous, or fraudulent, may undermine the safety or the perception of safety on our platform and our ability to attract and retain hosts and guests and materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition . \n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot control or predict the actions of users and third parties, such as neighbors or invitees, during stays or experiences, including actions that may compromise the safety of hosts, guests, and others. Incidents involving alleged fatalities, injuries, sexual violence, fraud, privacy invasion, property damage, and discrimination have occurred and may occur in the future, potentially leading to legal liabilities and reputational damage. When a user is identity verified, it means that they provided information we validated through our process. In addition, we do not currently and may not in the future require users to re-verify their identity following their successful completion of the initial verification process. We conduct background checks for certain U.S. and Indian users and we screen users against sanctions watch lists, but these are not exhaustive due to regulatory, information, and frequency limitations. We do not verify all listings for safety or compliance, relying instead on user-reported issues, which may be incomplete or inaccurate. We have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to independently verify the safety, suitability, location, quality, compliance with Airbnb policies or standards, and legal compliance, such as fire code compliance or the presence of carbon monoxide detectors, hidden cameras or pool safety, of all our hosts&#8217; listings or experiences. We have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to independently verify the location, safety, or suitability of experiences for individual guests, the suitability, qualifications, or credentials of experiences hosts, or the qualifications of individual experiences guests. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have faced civil litigation, regulatory investigations, and inquiries involving allegations related to unsafe listings, discriminatory practices, and other misconduct. Despite efforts to enhance trust and safety, we may not fully succeed, impacting public perception and platform adoption. \n",
      "\n",
      "If hosts, guests, or third parties engage in criminal activity, misconduct, fraudulent, negligent, or inappropriate conduct, or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, we may receive negative media coverage, or be subject to involvement in a government investigation concerning such activity, which could adversely impact our brand and reputation, potentially leading consumers to think our platform and the listings on our platform are not safe, and lower the adoption rate of our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, certain regions where we operate have higher reported rates of violent crime or varying safety requirements, which can lead to more safety and security incidents, and may adversely impact the adoption of our platform in those regions and elsewhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, claims have been asserted against us from our hosts, guests, and third parties for compensation due to alleged fatalities, shootings, other violent acts, carbon monoxide incidents, hidden camera incidents, accidents, injuries, assaults, theft, property damage, data privacy and data security issues, fraudulent listings, and other incidents that are caused by other hosts, guests, or third parties while using our platform. These claims subject us to potentially significant liability and reputational damage, increase our operating costs and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have obtained some third-party insurance, which is subject to certain conditions and exclusions, for claims and losses incurred based on incidents related to bookings on our platform. Our insurance policies, which may or may not be applicable to all claims and may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all, may be inadequate to fully cover alleged claims of liability, investigation costs, defense costs, and/or payouts. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant time and cost investigating and defending against them. As we expand our offerings, or if the quantity or severity of incidents increases, our insurance rates and our financial exposure will grow, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We track certain operational metrics, which are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our stock price, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We track operational metrics such as Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, Average Daily Rate (&#8220;ADR&#8221;), active listings, active bookers, hosts, guest arrivals, greenhouse gas emissions, and other ESG metrics, which may differ from third-party estimates due to varying methodologies and assumptions. Our internal systems have limitations, and changes in tracking methods could lead to unexpected metric variations. Errors in these systems may result in inaccurate data reporting. Metrics like Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV are adjusted for cancellations and alterations that happen in the reporting period, but such cancellations and alterations can occur beyond the reporting period and can affect future metrics. Calculating these operational metrics requires ongoing data collection on new offerings that are added to our platform over time. Our business is complex, and the methodology used to calculate these metrics may require adjustments to accurately represent the full value of new offerings. \n",
      "\n",
      "An active booker is a unique guest who has booked a stay or experience in a given time period. Certain individuals may have more than one guest account and therefore may be counted more than once in our count of active bookers. We count the number of hosts on our platform based on the number of hosts with an available listing as of a certain date. Some individuals may have more than one host account and therefore may be counted more than once as hosts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fraudulent activities not identified by our systems can also skew metrics, impacting their accuracy. Inaccurate metrics or perceptions of inaccuracy could harm our reputation, affect our stock price, lead to litigation, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Financial and Insurance Risks \n",
      "\n",
      "Our failure to properly manage funds held on behalf of customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We offer integrated payments in approximately 50 currencies to allow access to guest demand from more than 220 countries and regions and the ability for many hosts to be paid in their local currency or payment method of choice. When a guest books and pays for a stay or experience on our platform, we hold the total amount the guest has paid until check-in, at which time we recognize our service fee as revenue and initiate the process to remit the payment to the host, which generally occurs 24 hours after the scheduled check-in, barring any alterations or cancellations, which may result in funds being returned to the guest. Accordingly, at any given time, we hold on behalf of our hosts and guests a substantial amount of funds, which are generally held in bank deposit accounts and in U.S. government money market funds and recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to either safeguard customer funds in bankruptcy-remote bank accounts, or hold such funds in eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in such jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount held on behalf of customers. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the cash underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our platform and services, and result in significant penalties and fines from regulators, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The insurance coverage afforded by or available from our insurers may be inadequate for the needs of our business, and losses under our damage protection program could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to manage the exposures related to our business operations. We support our host community by maintaining a variety of host protection programs, such as AirCover for Hosts, which includes Host Liability Insurance, Experiences Liability Insurance, and our Host Damage Protection program. \n",
      "\n",
      "In relation to Airbnb&#8217;s insurance programs, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if (i) cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our expectations; (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits; (iii) our insurance providers become insolvent or otherwise fail to pay on our insurance claims; (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is denied by or disputed by our insurance providers; (v) claims costs exceed our captive insurance subsidiary&#8217;s forecast or reserves; or (vi) the number of claims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historic averages. Our spending for insurance has increased as our business has grown and losses from covered claims have increased. Premiums have increased as a result, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased difficulty in obtaining appropriate policy limits and levels of coverage at a reasonable cost and with reasonable terms and conditions. Our costs for obtaining these policies will continue to increase as our business grows and continues to evolve. Furthermore, as our business continues to develop and diversify, we may experience difficulty in obtaining insurance coverage for new and evolving offerings, which could require us to incur greater costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In relation to our Host Damage Protection program, which is a commercial guaranty agreement that provides reimbursement of up to $3 million for certain guest-caused loss or damages to a host property that are not reimbursed by the guest, we maintain a contractual liability insurance policy to provide coverage to us for losses incurred by us under the Host Damage Protection program. Increased frequency and severity and increased fraud could result in greater payouts, increased investigation costs, premium increases, and/or difficulty securing insurance coverage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, if we fail to comply with insurance regulatory requirements in the regions where we operate, or other regulations governing insurance coverage, our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on third-party payment service providers to process payments made by guests and payments made to hosts on our platform. If these third-party payment service providers become unavailable or if we are subject to increased fees, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on a number of third-party payment service providers, including payment card networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways, to link us to payment card and bank clearing networks to process payments made by our guests and to remit payments to hosts on our platform. If these providers, some of whom are the sole providers of their particular service, become unable or unwilling to offer services on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be disrupted, requiring us to find alternatives providers and they may not be able to be replaced in a timely manner, or at all, or on favorable terms. Transitioning to new providers would demand significant resources and might not be well-received by users, potentially leading to losses and necessitating payments to hosts from our funds, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the software and services from these providers may fail to meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised, or experience outages, all of which could impact our ability to process payments, make timely payments to hosts, or comply with regulatory requirements, which could deter users and harm our reputation, possibly leading to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, or enforcement action. Agreements with providers may even allow them to hold our cash as a reserve under certain conditions, such as adverse business changes, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, and such fees result in significant costs. Payment card networks may impose special fees or assessments on any transaction that accesses their network. Our payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees, assessments or special fees on to us. Such interchange and other fees may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. \n",
      "\n",
      "Credit card transactions result in higher fees to us than transactions made through debit cards. Any material increase in interchange fees in the United States or other geographies, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations imposed by law in some geographies, or other network fees or assessments, or a shift from payment with debit cards to credit cards among our guests could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, inadequate investment in our payment infrastructure could hinder functionality and competitiveness, affecting usage. Further, expanding our payment services into additional geographies or offering new methods may introduce additional regulations and fraud risks, which would increase operating expenses. \n",
      "\n",
      "If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses or be unable to process payment transactions. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and other investments, including money market funds, certificates of deposit, U.S. government debt securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, government agency debt securities, mortgaged-backed and asset-backed securities, with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad for both our corporate balances and for funds held on behalf of our hosts and guests. We also rely on such banks and financial institutions to help process payments transactions. We have both significant funds flows from and to various financial institutions as a result of our processing of payments from guests to hosts. As part of our currency hedging activities on these balances, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and manage this exposure in an attempt to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition, or service interruptions at, or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets may be limited by the counterparty&#8217;s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, our ability to process payment transactions via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses and be required to make payments to hosts and/or refunds to guests out of our own funds, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition. Our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness. \n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2021, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the &#8220;2026 Notes&#8221;). In addition, on October 31, 2022, we entered into a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with $1.0 billion of initial commitments from a group of lenders (&#8220;2022 Credit Facility&#8221;). As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility, and we had total outstanding letters of credit of $19 million under the 2022 Credit Facility. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our ability to make payments under or to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, certain provisions of our 2026 Notes and related agreements could complicate or increase the cost for a third-party seeking to acquire us. Noteholders may require us to repurchase their notes for cash following a fundamental change, potentially straining our financial resources and leading to defaults under the indenture or other debt agreements. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the accounting treatment of the 2026 Notes as a liability and the use of the \"if-converted\" method for earnings per share calculations may negatively impact our reported financials. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the capped call transactions entered into in connection with the pricing of the 2026 Notes may affect the value of our Class A common stock. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, our existing credit agreement for our 2022 Credit Facility contains, and any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants, including a leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants, that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital, or make payments under our other indebtedness. The covenants in the agreement governing our 2022 Credit Facility, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries&#8217; abilities to (i) incur additional indebtedness at subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the 2022 Credit Facility; (ii) create or incur additional liens; (iii) partake in sale/leaseback transactions; (iv) engage in certain fundamental changes, including mergers or consolidations; and (v) enter into negative pledge clauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. \n",
      "\n",
      "Operational Risks \n",
      "\n",
      "The failure to successfully execute and integrate acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have acquired multiple businesses and we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, which indebtedness could result in restrictions on our business and significant use of available cash to make payments of interest and principal. In addition, we may finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could result in further dilution to our existing stockholders. We may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we may not be successful in integrating acquisitions, or the businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. While our acquisitions to date have not caused major disruptions in our business, any future failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; difficulties in integrating and managing the combined operations, technology platforms, or offerings of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays, and failure to execute on the intended strategy and synergies; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; failure of the acquired businesses to achieve anticipated revenue, earnings, or cash flow; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; diversion of management&#8217;s attention or other resources from our existing business; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; our inability to maintain the key customers, business relationships, suppliers, and brand potential of acquired businesses; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; uncertainty of entry into businesses or geographies in which we have limited or no prior experience or in which competitors have stronger positions; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; unanticipated costs associated with pursuing acquisitions or greater than expected costs in integrating the acquired businesses; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; responsibility for the liabilities of acquired businesses, including those that were not disclosed to us or exceed our estimates, such as liabilities arising out of the failure to maintain effective data protection and privacy controls, and liabilities arising out of the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including tax laws; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; difficulties in or costs associated with assigning or transferring to us or our subsidiaries the acquired companies&#8217; intellectual property or its licenses to third-party intellectual property; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; inability to maintain our culture and values, ethical standards, controls, procedures, and policies; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; challenges in integrating the workforce of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; \n",
      "\n",

      "From time to time, we also make investments in private companies, which are inherently risky. To the extent our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we have recognized an expense to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value. Negative changes in the estimated fair value of private companies in which we invest could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

      "Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in accounting principles. \n",
      "\n",
      "The accounting for our business is subject to change based on the evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations of accounting and financial reporting requirements of the SEC or other regulatory agencies. Adoption of a change in accounting principles or interpretations \n",
      "\n",
      "could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the adoption of such change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles and accounting policies over financial reporting, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could require significant investment in systems and personnel. \n",

      "Our business depends on attracting and retaining capable management and employees, and the loss of any key personnel could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management and employees. Our founders and other members of our senior management team, as well as other employees, may terminate their employment with us at any time, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "As we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel we need. The loss of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate employees required for the planned expansion of our business, would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition and impair our ability to grow. To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may be adversely affected by declines in our stock price. Additionally, if we issue significant equity to attract employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional stock-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. \n",

      "We have adopted a Live and Work Anywhere policy. The increase in remote working subjects us to certain operational challenges and could have adverse tax implications, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, we adopted our Live and Work Anywhere policy, which permits the majority of our employees to work remotely. Remote working subjects us to operational challenges and risks. For example, a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event may impact our employees&#8217; ability to work remotely. In addition, members of our workforce who work remotely may not have access to technology that is as robust as that in our offices, which could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to those remote workers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. We are also exposed to risks associated with the locations of remote workers, including compliance with local laws and regulations or exposure to compromised internet infrastructure. Allowing members of our workforce to work remotely creates intellectual property risk if employees create intellectual property on our behalf while residing in a jurisdiction with unenforced or uncertain intellectual property laws. Further, if employees fail to inform us of changes in their work location, we may unknowingly be exposed to additional risks. Remote working at our company (and at many third-party providers) also results in consumer, privacy, information technology and cybersecurity, and fraud risks due to the challenges associated with managing remote computing assets and security vulnerabilities that are present in many non-corporate and home networks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our transition to full or predominantly remote work environments also presents significant challenges to maintaining compliance with country and state requirements such as employee income tax withholding, the recording of reserves to cover withholding corrections or penalties, payroll tax remittance and reporting, payroll registration, and workers&#8217; compensation insurance. Additionally, foreign tax authorities may assert that certain of our entities have created permanent establishment in their countries , which could result in additional corporate income taxes and employee payroll withholding obligations. Any of these operational challenges or tax implications resulting from our Live and Work Anywhere policy may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Our financial performance is dependent on the strength of the travel and hospitality industries, which can be significantly impacted by events beyond our control such as extreme weather, natural disasters, pandemics or public health crises, economic downturns, political unrest, wars, and changes in travel-related policies. These unpredictable events can abruptly alter consumer travel behavior, reducing demand for our platform and services, and materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Climate change and other environmental or social pressures, as well as societal responses to same, may exacerbate or lead to additional impacts from such events. For more information, see our risk factor titled &#8220;We are subject to risks associated with the physical impacts of climate change as well as various efforts to transition to a low-carbon society.&#8221; \n",
      "\n",
      "Macroeconomic conditions, including economic downturns, inflation, tariffs, and currency fluctuations, also influence consumer discretionary spending, which is crucial for our business. Factors like unemployment, consumer debt, and financial market volatility can decrease consumer confidence and spending, particularly affecting leisure travel, which forms a substantial part of our business. Economic downturns have historically reduced travel spending, and future downturns could similarly decrease demand for our platform, leading to lower bookings, increased cancellations, and reduced revenue, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Hosts have numerous options for listing their spaces and experiences, both online and offline, and often cross-list their offerings. We compete for hosts based on factors like booking volume, platform usability, service fees, host protections, and brand and reputation. Guests also have various options \n",

      "\n",
      "Our competitors include OTAs, search engines, listing and meta-search websites, hotel chains, property management companies, and online experience platforms. Many competitors have advantages such as greater brand recognition, larger marketing budgets, and more resources. They may offer a more comprehensive product experience and respond more effectively to market changes. They may develop technological advancements that allow them to offer better products and services at a lower price. Failure to offer or deploy new technologies as effectively as our competitors could adversely affect our business. Industry consolidation and emerging start-ups further intensify competition, potentially impacting our growth and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous companies offer homes for booking, often cross-listed on multiple platforms, which can make our pricing appear less competitive for a number of reasons, including differences in fee structure and policies. Some property managers and hosts encourage direct bookings, bypassing our platform, which reduces our usage. Competitors with established consumer relationships may leverage these to enter the travel market, creating &#8220;super-apps&#8221; that integrate multiple services, potentially increasing our customer acquisition costs and affecting our competitive position. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also face competition from search engines like Google, which can influence search traffic and promote their own travel services, potentially disintermediating our platform.

For example, the physical impacts of climate change (which may include more frequent or severe storms, extreme weather events, extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, hurricanes, flooding, rising sea levels, shortages of water, droughts, wildfires, and natural disasters) may interrupt infrastructure on which our platform relies, impact demand or supply for lodging, or otherwise adversely impact our business. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of certain such events, as well as contribute to chronic changes (such as changes to meteorological and hydrological patterns) that may also impact the behaviors of guests and hosts or infrastructure on which we rely. \n",
      "\n",
      "Growing awareness of climate and other environmental or social pressures, including over-tourism, has also prompted responses by various actors in society, which may adversely impact the travel and hospitality industries and demand for our platform and services, whether due to the imposition of policies and regulations or changing societal attitudes towards travel. For example, both we and hosts are increasingly subject to regulatory requirements related to climate-related considerations, and any additional regulations may require increased costs or attention for compliance. Our platform and services may also be adversely impacted to the extent travel behavior or other societal expectations shift in response to climate considerations, including if we do not successfully navigate stakeholder expectations regarding our own response to climate change. \n",

For example, the effect of significant downturns in bookings in a particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods due to this timing difference. Our expense levels are based on revenue estimates that may be inaccurate, and fixed expenses may lead to greater-than-expected losses if revenue falls short. Incorrect assumptions or failure to address risks could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "A significant portion of our bookings and revenue are denominated in foreign currencies, and our financial results are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. \n",

      "A significant portion of our business is denominated and transacted in foreign currencies, which subjects us to foreign exchange risk. We offer integrated payments to our hosts and guests in approximately 50 currencies. Revenue could be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Generally speaking, a strong U.S. dollar can negatively impact our revenue, as approximately 54% of our revenue in 2024 was in non-U.S. dollar currencies. We also face foreign exchange risk with certain assets, like cash balances held for hosts and guests, affecting our financial results through currency remeasurement and translation. Our platform allows guests to pay in their preferred currency, which may differ from the host's payment currency, leading to currency risk due to timing differences. \n",
      "\n",
      "We utilize a foreign exchange cash flow hedging program to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on our revenue.

      "We are subject to evolving global tax regimes, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;) introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax and an excise tax on stock repurchases. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we accrued approximately $95 million of corporate alternative minimum tax, and approximately $20 million of excise tax on stock repurchases. Additionally, the U.S. government may implement further changes, such as increasing the corporate income tax rate or altering the taxation of international income. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and states, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries and states where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. For example, in Italy, a law enacted in 2017 purports to require short-term rental platforms that process payments to withhold and remit host income tax and collect and remit tourist tax, amongst other obligations. In December 2023, without admitting any liability, Airbnb Ireland signed an agreement with the Italian Revenue Agency in settlement of the 2017-2021 audit periods for an aggregate payment of 576 million Euro ($621 million). Additionally, in December 2024, Airbnb Ireland signed a similar agreement in settlement of the 2022 audit period for an aggregate payment of 139 million Euro ($150 million). Such agreements settle a dispute about Airbnb Ireland&#8217;s obligations to withhold and remit host income tax, including taxes, interest, and penalties, for those relevant periods. Airbnb&#8217;s subsidiary in Italy and Airbnb Ireland continue to be, or could in the future be, subject to tax audits in Italy, including in relation to permanent establishment, transfer pricing, withholding obligations, and tourist taxes. Such audits could result in the imposition of additional potentially significant prior and future tax obligations. \n",

      "Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and determine the value of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including those of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation, and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Airbnb. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

      "We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. For example, our 2008 to 2024 tax years remain subject to examination in the United States and California due to tax attributes and statutes of limitations, and our 2020 to 2024 tax years remain subject to examination in Ireland. We are currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) for the years 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2018. We are continuing to respond to inquiries related to these examinations. In December 2020, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (&#8220;NOPA&#8221;) from the IRS for the 2013 tax year relating to the valuation of our international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. The notice proposed an increase to our U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of $1.3 billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $1.0 billion. We disagree with the proposed adjustment and intend to vigorously contest it. In January 2022, we entered into an administrative dispute process with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (&#8220;IRS Appeals&#8221;) regarding the proposed adjustment. An acceptable outcome was not reached with IRS Appeals, and in May 2024, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (&#8220;Notice&#8221;) from the IRS related to the aforementioned valuation of our international intellectual property. The Notice claims that we owe $1.3 billion in tax, plus penalties and interest. We will continue to pursue all available remedies to resolve this dispute. In July 2024, we petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (&#8220;Tax Court&#8221;) for redetermination, and if necessary, we will appeal the Tax Court&#8217;s decision to the \n",

      "appropriate appellate court. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position and such tax and related interest and penalties, if any, exceeds our current reserves, such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations, and any assessment of additional tax could require a significant cash payment and have a material adverse impact on our cash flow. \n",

      "We face complex and evolving tax obligations across various jurisdictions, which could significantly impact our business. We are subject to numerous taxes, including income and indirect taxes, and have received demands from governments for data to enforce tax laws against our hosts and guests. We collect and remit taxes on behalf of hosts when legally required, but disputes and lawsuits over tax responsibilities persist. New or revised tax laws could increase our tax liabilities and operational costs, potentially leading to penalties for non-compliance. \n",

These taxes could raise costs for hosts and guests, discourage platform use, and reduce revenue. For example, we recorded approximately $53 million in expense related to digital service taxes relating to prior periods as a result of refining our interpretation of the law as it applies to us. Additionally, we recorded $18 million of lodging tax expense in a particular jurisdiction over uncertainty as to how a new law applies to us. Compliance with tax reporting may require disclosing personal data, risking privacy concerns and regulatory actions. Competitors may adopt different tax strategies, potentially attracting our hosts and guests. \n",
      "\n",
      "We devote significant resources, including management time, to the application and interpretation of laws and working with various jurisdictions to clarify whether taxes are applicable and the amount of taxes that apply.

Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that some of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future taxable income, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation&#8217;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change taxable income or income tax liabilities may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable income or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us. \n",

Such laws and regulations are complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and have limited and may continue to limit the ability or willingness of new or existing hosts to share their spaces through our platform. These regulations may expose our users or us to regulatory inquiries, litigation, and/or other disputes and to potentially significant liabilities, including taxes, compliance costs, fines, and criminal or other penalties, which have had and could continue to have a material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

These laws and regulations may impact the ability of hosts to list properties entirely and/or may limit the location and/or duration of stays permitted, or may establish other conditions upon which they are allowed to host. In addition, regulations may require that we, rather than local, state or national regulatory enforcement agencies, limit hosts&#8217; ability to list within those requirements. \n",

      "Compliance with diverse and evolving laws across jurisdictions is costly and complex, increasing our operational expenses and potential liabilities (including potential criminal or other penalties). For example, we incur significant operational costs to comply with requirements of jurisdictions and cities that have disparate requirements around tax collection, tax reporting, data sharing, host registration, limits on lengths of stays, and other regulations, each of which may require us to dedicate significant resources to provide the infrastructure and tools needed on our platform for our hosts to meet these legal requirements and for us to fulfill any obligations we may have. Environmental, health, and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs, and our hosts&#8217; costs, to comply with such requirements may increase as a result. The complexity of our platform and changes required to comply with the large number of varying \n",
      "\n",
      "requirements can lead to constraints on supply as well as compliance gaps. Additionally, unclear and changing laws can deter hosts and guests from using our platform, reduce supply and demand, and increase litigation risks, adversely affecting our business. Failure or delays in complying with laws, even if unclear or in dispute, could subject us to penalties, including fines, business disruption and site blocking. \n",
      "\n",
      "We require hosts and guests to comply with all applicable legal obligations under our terms of service, but governments may nonetheless seek to hold us accountable for hosts&#8217; and guests&#8217; compliance. This can lead to penalties and costs that impact our reputation and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our compliance measures, such as requiring hosts to include registration numbers for listings in some jurisdictions, may increase platform friction and reduce listings and bookings. Host listings may also be limited by night caps, density restrictions, onerous permitting requirements, primary residence or host presence requirements, permit caps, minimum night stays, and/or discretionary permitting or lottery systems. Additional regulations could necessitate significant platform changes, discouraging use and increasing scrutiny and liability. \n",

      "Regulatory Developments \n",
      "\n",
      "Hotels and groups affiliated with hotels have engaged and will likely continue to engage in various lobbying and political efforts for stricter regulations governing our business in both local and national jurisdictions. Additionally, private groups, such as homeowners and neighborhood associations, may adopt contracts or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict the ability of hosts to list their spaces. In some jurisdictions, regulations imposing restrictions on short-term rentals are increasingly fragmented at the local level, leading to increased compliance burden. These efforts, along with existing and potential new laws, could restrict short-term rentals, impose registration requirements and other limits to hosts&#8217; ability to list, and lead to significant fines and liabilities, materially affecting our platform's operations and financial condition. For instance, EU Member State laws pertaining to the recently enacted EU STR Regulation will require additional compliance efforts, potentially discouraging and prohibiting current and potential hosts from listing properties. As another example, the City of New York has effectively banned short-term rentals, and this has led to similar restrictions being considered throughout the State of New York. If other geographies emulate these regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We face ongoing disputes with government agencies over regulations, which may result in fines and operational changes. Some jurisdictions have imposed or may seek to impose taxes and licensing requirements on our platform and failure to comply could lead to penalties. We have resolved some disputes by agreeing to remove listings or share data with authorities. From time to time, we attempt to defend against application of laws and regulations that limit hosts&#8217; or guests&#8217; ability or willingness to list and search for accommodations, but have sometimes been and may continue to be unsuccessful in certain of those efforts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Increased regulatory interest in technology companies, particularly regarding AI, data privacy, competition, and sustainability, could lead to further compliance challenges.

Additionally, we are subject to claims related to incidents at listings, such as personal injuries, cancellations and refunds, and privacy violations, as well as class action lawsuits and government inquiries. If we become more involved in hosts&#8217; listings and conduct related to bookings, then we are more likely to draw scrutiny and additional regulations from governments and undercut various defenses we may have to claims or attempts to regulate us, which further constrain our business and impose additional liability on us as a platform. \n",

      "Since June 2022, guests in certain jurisdictions have had the opportunity to purchase travel insurance when they make a booking. Over time, we expect to make travel insurance available to guests in additional countries. In the United States, travel insurance products are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which we transact business by state insurance departments. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of consumers. States have also adopted legislation defining and prohibiting unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts and practices in the business of insurance that may apply to insurance agencies. Noncompliance with any of such state statutes may subject us to regulatory action by the relevant state insurance regulator, and, in certain states, private litigation. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that any new laws, rules, or regulations, or unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules or regulations, may have on our business and financial results. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and independent agents. State insurance regulators may also conduct periodic examinations, the results of which could give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action. Similarly, travel insurance products are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the applicable regulators in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the European Union. The failure to comply with applicable state and foreign laws and regulations could result in fines, investigations and/or civil or criminal proceedings against us by governmental agencies and/or consumers which, if material, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

As we expand further, we face varying and sometimes conflicting legal obligations. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in one jurisdiction may be prohibited by sanctions, AML, CTF, or other regulations in a different jurisdiction. We regularly assess our compliance programs and may identify gaps requiring costly enhancements to our policies and controls. \n",

      "Non-compliance or perceived failure to comply with these existing or new laws and regulations, including changes to or expansion of their interpretations, can lead to significant fines, lawsuits, regulatory and/or governmental investigations, enforcement actions, loss of required licenses and other civil and criminal penalties, forcing us to alter operations or delay product launches, adversely affecting our brand, business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects. The complexity of global regulations may trigger overlapping investigations by multiple authorities, impacting our relationships with financial institutions.

We are reliant on the principal firms to continue to permit us to use their licenses to offer or distribute these services/products and they can cancel our agreement, with notice, at any time, which could have an adverse impact on these revenue streams if we were unable to find suitable replacement principal firms. If we were found to have breached the terms of our agreement with the principal firms and/or breached regulatory requirements applicable to us, for example, by misrepresenting credit products to UK consumers, despite our not holding the licenses to perform these activities, we could nevertheless be liable to penalties imposed by the UK regulators.

In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which enforces federal consumer financial protection laws. We must comply with these laws, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E, which require service disclosures, error resolution, and consumer reimbursement for unauthorized transactions. The CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts, potentially increasing our compliance costs and litigation risks. Consumer protection laws could also be violated inadvertently, for example as a result of technical bugs. \n",

Among other things, the BSA and MLRs require money services businesses (including money transmitters like Airbnb Payments) to implement risk-based AML and CTF programs, report suspicious transactions or activities, and maintain transaction records. We must also comply with, among other requirements, the UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and Terrorism Act 2000, which prohibit the handling of criminal proceeds. We provide information to government agencies to assist in the detection and prevention of illegal activities and may be required to deny certain transactions, risking inadvertent denials of legal transfers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regulators may demand enhancements to our compliance programs, including customer identity verification and transaction monitoring. In the United Kingdom and European Union, stricter AML regulations could increase compliance costs and operational challenges and/or require us not to provide services to certain clients, potentially reducing business. Non-compliance with local laws implementing EU directives could result in fines up to 10% of APLux&#8217;s annual revenue, and similar penalties apply to APUK under the MLRs. \n",

      "The EU has agreed and adopted a comprehensive package of measures to reform the primary AML, CTF legislation across all EU 27 Member States (the package together is known as &#8220;MLD6&#8221;). This means that APLux will need to undertake a detailed impact assessment to the required uplifts to existing policies and procedures. This will likely result in material changes to the day to day AML and CTF operating procedures of APLux and material divergence between the AML and CTF rules applicable to APUK in the UK and those applicable to APLux, bringing with it increased costs and the regulatory enforcement risks (such as fines, censures and potentially the suspension or removal of regulatory licenses or controls placed on APLux&#8217;s ability to onboard new customers) associated with designing compliance with a nascent regime. \n",

      "Avoiding regulation under the Investment Company Act may adversely affect our operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which &#8220;investment companies&#8221; are permitted to conduct their business activities. We currently conduct, and intend to continue to conduct, our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We are not engaged primarily, nor do we hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. We do, however, make minority investments in companies and acquire other financial instruments from time to time that may be deemed investment securities. As such, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act without taking actions that may adversely affect our operations. For example, to avoid being deemed an investment company we may be required to sell certain of our assets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "ESG matters are an area of growing and evolving focus among our shareholders and other stakeholders, including customers, employees, regulators, politicians, and the general public in the United States and abroad. Companies like Airbnb face heightened expectations regarding matters such as environmental sustainability, diversity, human rights, and data privacy. We engage in various initiatives to serve our stakeholders in these and other areas, and to respond to stakeholder expectations regarding ESG, but such initiatives can be costly and may not have the desired effect. For example, many ESG initiatives (including related metrics and targets) are based on methodologies, standards, and data that are still evolving or are subject to variable interpretation; as with other companies, our approach to such matters evolves, and we cannot guarantee that our approach, either now or in future, will align with the expectations or preferences of any particular stakeholder or that certain disclosures will not be considered erroneous or subject to misinterpretation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, stakeholders have varying and sometimes conflicting perceptions of ESG matters. Both advocates and opponents of various issues are increasingly resorting to activism (including media campaigns and litigation) to advocate for their positions. Responding to such issues involves inherent costs, and any failure to successfully navigate stakeholder expectations could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. \n",
      "\n",
      "The regulatory landscape for ESG issues is also rapidly evolving, and various policymakers, including the European Union and State of California, among others, have adopted (or are considering adopting) requirements for climate- or other ESG-related disclosures or other actions. We may face risks related to sustainability reporting obligations under the evolving regulatory landscape in the European Union. Specifically, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (&#8220;CSRD&#8221;) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (&#8220;CSDDD&#8221;) impose stringent requirements on companies to disclose detailed information regarding their ESG practices. Furthermore, the transposition of the CSRD by EU member states will also impact the scope of these requirements. Many member states have not yet transposed the directive, adding another layer of uncertainty to compliance efforts. Additionally, the EU's Omnibus Simplification Package introduces further complexity and uncertainty in the European Union. Compliance involves significant expenses and resources, with risks of errors in implementing necessary changes. These requirements are not uniform, and may not be interpreted or applied uniformly, which may increase the cost and complexity of compliance, as well as any related risks. Various of our suppliers and other stakeholders are subject to similar risks, which may exacerbate, or create additional, risks on such matters. \n",

While a number of the infringement claims raised against us have been based on our use or implementation of third-party technologies for which those third parties have been required to defend against the claims on our behalf and indemnify us from liability, intellectual property claims against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle, and could divert our management&#8217;s attention and other resources. \n",

We process personal data, such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, nationality, location information, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, and identity verification information (for example, government issued identification or passport), as well as credit card, bank account or other financial information, from and about hosts and guests, as well as our employees, job applicants, contractors and representatives of our third-party vendors, and other companies we do business with. We utilize third-party vendors, some of whom process data for us and provide various services, including but not limited to digital storage technology, business technology support, and other support functions. We and our vendors must comply with various state, federal, and foreign data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements, including those that generally require that we implement reasonable measures to keep such information secure and otherwise restrict the ways in which such information can be collected and used.

Our technology platform incorporates the use of AI and ML Technologies, for example, for fraud detection, search, enabling customized features and enhancing community support. Enhanced scrutiny of the use of AI and ML Technologies means that regulators may increasingly seek advance engagement with businesses like ours in respect of certain types of data processing. In addition, certain existing legal regimes, including those relating to data privacy and consumer protection, regulate certain aspects of AI and ML Technologies, and new laws regulating AI and ML Technologies have been or may be enacted or have entered into force in jurisdictions that we operate. This may affect our use of AI and ML Technologies and our ability to provide, improve or commercialize our services effectively and efficiently and result in increased costs. For example, in the United States, California enacted seventeen new laws in 2024 that further regulate the use of AI and ML Technologies and provide consumers with additional protections around companies&#8217; use of AI and ML Technologies, such as requiring companies to disclose certain uses of generative AI. Other states have also passed AI-focused legislation, such as Colorado&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Act, which will require developers and deployers of &#8220;high-risk&#8221; AI systems to implement certain safeguards against algorithmic discrimination, and Utah&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, which establishes disclosure requirements and accountability measures for the use of generative AI in certain consumer interactions. Other legislation has been introduced or proposed at the federal and state level, and there remains uncertainty at the federal level regarding the regulation of AI and ML Technologies. Further, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (the &#8220;EU AI Act&#8221;) entered into force in August 2024, and establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market. The majority of the substantive requirements will apply from August 2026. The EU AI Act applies to companies that develop, use and/or provide AI in the EU and &#8211; depending on the AI use case &#8211; includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose AI and foundation models, and fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover. These regulations may impact our ability to use, procure and commercialize AI and ML Technologies in the future, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our products or services, including if the laws are not consistent across jurisdictions. \n",

      "In the European Union and the UK, we are subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the &#8220;EU GDPR&#8221;) and to the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (the &#8220;UK GDPR&#8221;), respectively (the EU GDPR and UK GDPR together referred to as the &#8220;GDPR&#8221;), both of which have resulted, and will continue to result, in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies like ours. The GDPR comprehensively regulates our use of personal data, including cross-border transfers of personal data out of Europe. Many large geographies in which we operate, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, and South Korea have passed or are in the process of passing comparable or other robust data privacy and security legislation or regulation, which may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. \n",
      "\n",
      "In relation to cross-border transfers of personal data outside of Europe, we expect the existing legal complexity and uncertainty regarding international personal data transfers to continue. In particular, the European Commission approval of the current EU-US Data Privacy Framework for data transfers to certified entities in the United States may be challenged, which could also lead to challenges to, or impact the effectiveness of, other data transfer mechanisms such as the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism). In general, we expect that international transfers to the United States and to other jurisdictions more generally to continue to be subject to enhanced scrutiny by regulators and we cannot guarantee the ongoing efficacy of our data transfer mechanisms. It is also possible that transfers of personal data outside the United States could be restricted or impacted by developments at the federal level. As the regulatory guidance and enforcement landscape in relation to data transfers continue to develop, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, and/or regulatory investigations or fines, we may have to stop using certain tools and vendors and make other operational changes, including updating agreements or implementing additional safeguards which could otherwise affect the manner in which we provide our services, our ability to provide our services and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time, we receive correspondence, and are subject to more formal inquiries, from regulators including the Irish Data Protection Commission, our lead EU data protection regulator, regarding our personal data processing activities. To date, we have not received any fines in respect of statutory inquiries and have in place an internal process to review and process such inquiries to ensure we respond appropriately and update our privacy compliance with any findings. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, there are numerous federal and state data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, maintenance, disclosure and processing of personal data, including federal and state data privacy laws, data breach notification laws, electronic communications laws, and marketing and consumer protection laws. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and state regulators enforce a variety of data privacy issues, such as misrepresentations in privacy policies or failures to appropriately protect information about individuals, as unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of the FTC Act or similar state laws. Additionally, the GLBA and its implementing regulations, restrict and impose certain requirements on the processing of personal data, including notice to individuals of privacy practices and requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal data. Moreover, as we send marketing messages via email and short message service, or SMS, text messages, we are subject to the CAN-SPAM Act, which imposes certain obligations regarding the content of emails and providing and honoring opt-outs, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which imposes restrictions on the ability to send text messages without prior consent. \n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. government, including Congress, the FTC, the CFPB and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning personal data processing practices and consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. In addition, numerous states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the processing of state residents&#8217; personal data that have and may continue to require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur related costs and expenses. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;) provides enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording residents the right to access and delete their data and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal data. The CCPA imposes a range of other compliance obligations and imposes severe statutory damages, which could lead to injunctive relief or agreed settlements providing for ongoing audit and reporting requirements, as well as a private right of action, for certain data breaches. This private right of action has increased the risks associated with data breach litigation. The enactment of the CCPA prompted a wave of similar legislative developments in other states, which creates a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. For example, since the CCPA went into effect, comprehensive privacy statutes that share similarities with the CCPA are now in effect and enforceable in other states. Many other states have passed or proposed similar laws and there remains increased interest at the federal level as well. \n",

      "We are also subject to evolving EU and UK privacy laws on cookies, tracking technologies and e-marketing. In the European Union and United Kingdom, informed consent is required for the placement of certain cookies or similar tracking technologies on an individual&#8217;s device and for direct electronic marketing. Recent European court and regulator decisions are driving increased attention to cookies and similar tracking technologies, which may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. \n",

      "Further, the majority of the substantive provisions of the DSA took effect in February 2024. The DSA governs, among other things, our potential liability for illegal services/products or content on our platform, obligations around traceability of business users, and requires enhanced transparency measures. In particular our obligations to diligence the services offered on our platform could require significant additional resources. Further, the DSA contains general requirements that user interfaces may not deceive or manipulate users which are yet to be clarified further by guidance. The DSA may increase our compliance costs, require changes to our user interfaces, processes, operations, and business practices which may adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and provide our services to customers, and may otherwise adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with the DSA can result in fines of up to 6% of total annual worldwide turnover and recipients of services have the right to seek compensation from providers in respect of damage or loss suffered due to infringement by the provider to comply with the DSA. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the Online Safety Act 2023, or the OSA, establishes an extensive regulatory framework for certain user-to-user and search services and imposes obligations to protect users from illegal content which, if applicable, may increase compliance costs and may otherwise adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with the OSA can result in fines of up to 10% of total annual worldwide turnover or &#163;18 million (whichever is greater). \n",
      "\n",
      "Various other governments and consumer agencies around the world have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically. Together, these existing and proposed laws add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources to compliance programs and cybersecurity, which could impact strategies, and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. Compliance with numerous and often contradictory requirements of different jurisdictions is particularly difficult for an online business such as ours, which collects personal information from hosts, guests, and other individuals in multiple jurisdictions. If any jurisdiction in which we operate adopts new laws or changes its interpretation of its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or localization such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we could risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. As in many cases these laws are relatively new and the interpretation and application of these laws is uncertain. There may be litigation, claims and enforcement relating to data privacy, and the processing of personal data may involve new interpretations of privacy laws. For example, there has been a noticeable increase in class actions in the United States where plaintiffs have utilized a variety of laws, including state wiretapping laws, in relation to the use of tracking technologies, such as cookies and pixels. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, to help improve the trust and safety on our platform, we conduct certain verification procedures aimed at our hosts, guests, and listings in certain jurisdictions. Such verification procedures may include utilizing public information on the Internet, accessing public databases such as court records, utilizing third-party vendors to analyze host or guest data, or physical inspection. These types of activities expose us to requirements of other laws and regulations, and to the risk of regulatory engagement and/or enforcement from privacy regulators, consumer protection agencies, consumer credit reporting agencies, and civil litigation. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we are required to disclose personal data to government agencies, such as tax authorities and law enforcement agencies, this could be perceived by third parties as non-compliance with data privacy and security laws, potentially leading to legal proceedings or actions \n",
      "\n",
      "against us. Conversely, if we refuse to provide requested information due to a disagreement, such as on the interpretation of the law, we may face actions, litigation, and increased regulatory scrutiny, which could harm our relationships with governments and limit our ability to operate in certain regions. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Any failure or perceived failure by us and/or our vendors or third-party providers to comply with data privacy and data security laws, rules, or regulations could expose us to material penalties, significant legal liability, changes in how we operate or offer our products, and interruptions or cessation of our ability to operate in key geographies, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, as we are subject to both the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, we could be fined under each regime independently in respect of the same breach. Penalties for certain breaches are up to the greater of &#8364;20 million or &#163;17.5 million, or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. \n",

      "In addition, any failure or perceived failure to comply with consumer protection, marketing, data privacy or data security laws, rules, and regulations; policies; industry standards; or enforcement notices and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit) could lead to legal actions by individuals, consumer rights groups, government agencies, or others. We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation, injunctive relief, or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, and diversion of internal resources or other regulatory orders adversely impacting the ways our business can use personal data. These proceedings could be costly to litigate, whether or not they have merit, and result in negative publicity and erode trust, potentially requiring us to make costly changes to our business practices. If these events occur, they could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition, and overall results. \n",

      "Since our founding, we have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our platform. We rely on computer systems, hardware, software, technology infrastructure, and online sites and networks for both internal and external operations that are critical to our business (collectively, &#8220;IT Systems&#8221;). We own and manage some of these IT Systems but also rely on third-party IT Systems for certain operations, including payment processing and accounting. Significant consumer growth or third-party failures may require costly upgrades, potentially affecting our business, and if our systems and network infrastructure cannot be expanded or are not scaled to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience significant operational interruptions, including poor performance, incorrect payments, search ranking issues, unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, and delays in the introduction of new offerings, decreased customer satisfaction, and loss of users. Our reliance on the Internet and mobile networks could also lead to disruptions in access. Our IT Systems, including those from third-party providers, are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters. For example, our San Francisco operations are at risk from earthquakes and power outages, which could disrupt business operations. Such disruptions could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have experienced IT System failures from time to time. While we invest in system reliability, these measures may not fully prevent downtime, and our existing business interruption insurance may not cover all losses or be available to us on economically reasonable terms in the future or at all. For further information, see the risk factor titled &#8220;If we or our third-party providers fail to protect confidential information and/or experience security incidents, there may be damage to our brand and reputation, material financial penalties, and legal liability, along with a decline in use of our platform, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.&#8221; \n",

If any such third-party AI and ML Technologies become incompatible with our offerings or unavailable for use or have degradations in performance, or if the providers of such models unfavorably change the terms on which their AI and ML Technologies are offered or terminate their relationship with us, our solutions may become less appealing to our customers. In addition, to the extent any third-party AI and ML Technologies are used as a vendor hosted service, any disruption, outage, or loss of information through such hosted services could disrupt our operations or solutions, damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our solutions, or result in legal claims or proceedings, for which we may be unable to recover damages from the affected provider. \n",

Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or proposed additional laws and regulations. Additionally, existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect the operation of and availability of IP protection for our AI and ML Technologies. As a result, implementation standards, enforcement practices, and available scope of protection are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, or standards may have on our business (including our positioning with respect to our competition) and may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these laws or regulations. Already, certain existing legal regimes (e.g., relating to data privacy) regulate certain aspects of AI and ML Technologies, and new laws regulating AI and ML Technologies are expected to continue to be proposed and enacted in the United States and globally. For further information related to AI laws and regulations that may affect our business, see the risk factor titled &#8220;Compliance with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to data privacy, data security, artificial intelligence, marketing and consumer protection involves significant expenditure and resources, and any actual or perceived failure by us or our vendors to comply may result in significant liability, litigation or other legal action against us, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and/or result in regulatory scrutiny, fines and penalties and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.&#8221; \n",

Although content on our platform is typically generated by third parties, and not by us, claims of defamation, disparagement, negligence, warranty, personal harm, intellectual property infringement, or other alleged damages could be asserted against us, in addition to our hosts and guests. While we rely on legal exemptions and protections like the DMCA and CDA in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in the European Union, varying laws and interpretations regarding immunity and responsibility across jurisdictions may limit these exemptions or defenses or create uncertainty regarding liability for information or content uploaded by hosts, guests, or other third parties. To the extent that Airbnb creates or is deemed to create or facilitate such content on the platform, these defenses may be less available. New regulations could increase our liability and compliance costs, impacting our business. \n",

While these initiatives are crucial for community trust, they can increase platform friction, potentially reducing host and guest activity and materially adversely affecting our business. These trust and safety efforts, including limited verification of hosts and listings and restrictions on certain types of bookings, our neighborhood hotline, or other initiatives, incur significant costs and may lead to fewer listings and bookings. \n",

      "As a global platform, the implementation of these measures varies by region and may be limited by local laws. Despite our investments, we cannot guarantee these measures will be successful, significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on or off our platform, or be sufficient to protect our reputation in the event of such activity. Additionally, our community standards, including commitments to inclusion and belonging that are required when a user joins Airbnb, may not always be clearly communicated or well understood by all parts of our community, leading to unmet expectations among hosts and guests, which may lead to fewer listings and bookings. \n",

In addition, the use of third-party open-source software could expose us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software to the extent open-source licensors do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software equivalent to those provided by third-party commercial software providers. We also license to others some of our software through open-source projects. Open sourcing our own software requires us to make the source code publicly available, and therefore can limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to that software. From time to time, companies that use open-source software have faced claims challenging the use of open-source software or compliance with open-source license terms. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or claiming noncompliance with open-source licensing terms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inadvertent use of open-source software can occur in software development in the Internet and technology industries. Such inadvertent use of open source software could expose us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of the underlying licenses, which could lead to unforeseen business disruptions, including being restricted from offering parts of our platform which incorporate the software, being required to publicly release proprietary source code, being required to re-engineer parts of our code base to comply with license terms, or being required to extract the open source software at issue. Our exposure to these risks may be increased as a result of evolving our core source code base, introducing new offerings, integrating acquired-company technologies, or making other business changes, including in areas where we do not currently compete.

We and certain of our third-party service providers have experienced cyberattacks and other security incidents in the past, including distributed denial-of-service type attacks on our IT Systems that have made portions of our platform slow or unavailable for periods of time. Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques&#8212;including AI&#8212;that circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove forensic evidence, which means that we and our third-party providers may be unable to detect, investigate, contain or recover from future attacks or incidents in a timely or effective manner. Despite significant investments in security, we cannot fully mitigate these risks, and such security incidents could disrupt operations and lead to negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of users, increased support costs, regulatory fines, legal claims (including class actions), and significant financial losses, especially under laws which impose statutory damages per breached record, all of which could materially impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Third parties also provide services to key aspects of our operations, including Internet connections and networking, messaging, data storage and processing, trust and safety, security infrastructure, source code management, and testing and deployment. In addition, we rely on third parties for many aspects of our payments platform, and the vast majority of our community support operations is performed by a limited number of third-party service providers. We also rely on Google Maps and other third-party services for maps and location data that are core to the functionality of our platform, and we integrate applications, content, and data from third parties to deliver our platform and services. \n",

Despite our efforts to use commercially reasonable diligence in the selection and retention of such third-party providers, such efforts may be insufficient or inadequate to prevent or remediate such risks. Some of our third-party providers, including our cloud computing providers and our payment processing partners, have been and may be subject to further intrusions, computer viruses, malicious software (such as ransomware), denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, terrorism, or other misconduct, and incidents due to inadvertent error or malfeasance by employees, contractors or other parties. There can be no assurance that our service providers will anticipate or prevent all types of attacks or that any security measures will be effective against all types of cybersecurity threats and risks. Our service providers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events, and they may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, each of which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail to or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our platform and services, increase prices, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to our competitors. If we are unable to procure alternatives in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be subject to business disruptions, losses, or costs to remediate any of these deficiencies and reputational harm. Our systems currently do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing or payment processing, and business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective.

Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors.

Our share repurchase program authorizations do not have an expiration date nor do they obligate us to acquire any specific number or dollar value of shares. Our share repurchase programs may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our Class A common stock.

      "Under our restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of Class C common stock. Any future issuance of Class C common stock may have the effect of further concentrating voting control in the holders of our Class B common stock, including the Class B common stock held by our founders, and may discourage potential acquisitions of our business, and could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. \n",

      "Under our restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of Class C common stock. We may in the future issue shares of Class C common stock for a variety of corporate purposes, including financings, acquisitions, investments, and equity incentives to our employees, consultants, and directors. Our authorized but unissued shares of Class C common stock are available for issuance with the approval of our board of directors without stockholder approval, except as may be required by the Listing Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;). Because the Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), is not convertible into any other capital stock, and is not listed for trading on an exchange or registered for sale with the SEC, shares of Class C common stock may be less liquid and less attractive to any future recipients of these shares than shares of Class A common stock, although we may seek to list the Class C common stock for trading and register shares of Class C common stock for sale in the future. In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, the holders of our Class B common stock, including our founders who are parties to a Nominating Agreement and a Voting Agreement, may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us that stockholders may otherwise support, and could allow us to take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, such issuances would have a dilutive effect on the economic interests of our Class A and Class B common stock. Any such issuance of Class C common stock could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. \n",

We may engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, our stockholders will experience additional dilution when option holders exercise their right to purchase common stock under our equity incentive plans, when RSUs vest and settle, when we issue equity awards to our employees under our equity incentive plans, or when we otherwise issue additional equity. Additionally, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. \n",

      "There has been increased volatility in the financial and securities markets, which has generally made access to capital less certain and increased the cost of obtaining new capital. Should we require additional funding, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our ability to continue to support our business and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "Our Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, our Class C common stock has no votes per share, and our Class H common stock has no votes per share. Because of the 20-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively continue to control a significant percentage of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until all such outstanding shares of Class B common stock have converted into shares of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, our founders, who collectively hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, are party to a Voting Agreement under which each founder and his affiliates and certain other entities agree to vote their shares for the election of each individual founder to our board of directors. We and each of our founders are party to a Nominating Agreement under which we and the founders are required to take certain actions to include the founders in the slate of nominees nominated by our board of directors for the applicable class of directors, include them in our proxy statement, and solicit proxies or consents in favor of electing each founder to our board of directors. This concentrated control limits or precludes other stockholders&#8217; ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major \n",

      "Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes or transfers among our founders, if all of our founders agree to such transfers. Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Class B holder into one share of Class A common stock. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result, it is possible that one or more of the persons or entities holding our Class B common stock could gain significant voting control as other holders of Class B common stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into Class A common stock. In addition, the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock dilutes holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. In addition, any future issuances of common stock would be dilutive to holders of Class A common stock. For example, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. Further, each outstanding share of Class H common stock will convert into a share of Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis upon the sale of such share of Class H common stock to any person or entity that is not our subsidiary, which would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. \n",

      "\n",
      "Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our Class A common stock. The following material factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors, and oral statements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Risks Related to Our Business and Operations \n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue and Growth Risks \n",
      "\n",
      "We may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate or effectively manage growth or new opportunities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our future revenue growth depends on the growth of supply and demand for listings on our platform and the development and adoption of new offerings and initiatives. Our business is also affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide as well as trends in the global travel and hospitality industries and the short and long-term accommodation regulatory landscape. A softening of supply or demand for our current or future offerings, whether caused by events outside of our control, challenging macroeconomic and political conditions, changes in host and guest preferences, public health crises such as pandemics, and any of the other factors described in these Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or otherwise, may result in decreased revenue and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we fail to retain or add hosts and guests, if hosts fail to provide high-quality stays and experiences, if our new offerings and initiatives are unsuccessful, or if our community support offerings are inadequate, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business success is heavily reliant on both hosts and guests engaging with our platform. Hosts must maintain and enhance their listings by offering a variety of desirable, competitively priced, and high-quality stays and experiences, while providing exceptional hospitality and timely responses to guest inquiries. These factors are largely outside our direct control, and if hosts fail to meet these expectations, or if they choose to cross-list or list exclusively with competitors, or if we are unable to attract and retain hosts in a cost-effective manner, or at all, our revenue and business operations could be adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our ability to attract and retain guests is crucial and can be impacted by external factors such as pandemics, political instability, climate change, and economic downturns, as well as internal factors like competition, brand perception, and platform usability. Additionally, our brand and reputation are critical to our success, as they influence our ability to attract and retain hosts, guests, and employees. Any negative perceptions or incidents related to safety, security, or quality could harm our public image and business operations. Issues such as unreliable reviews, regulatory scrutiny, or negative media coverage can further damage trust within our community, materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to invest in the development of new offerings and initiatives, including innovations focused on improving our host and guest experiences; however, developing and delivering these new offerings and initiatives increase our expenses and our organizational complexity, and we may experience difficulties in developing and implementing these new offerings and initiatives. Our new offerings and initiatives have a high degree of risk, as they may involve unproven businesses with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience. There can be no assurance that our hosts and guests will adopt or respond positively to such offerings and initiatives, that we will be able to successfully manage the development and delivery of such offerings and initiatives, or that any of these offerings or initiatives will help attract and retain users on our platform and gain sufficient market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset associated expenses or liabilities. If our new offerings and initiatives are not successful, or if we fail to provide a seamless and satisfactory experience for both hosts and guests, or if our host protection programs, including those provided through AirCover for hosts, become ineffective, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, our growth relies on delivering high-quality support to our community, which requires significant investment in staffing, technology, infrastructure, and training. As our global customer base expands, particularly outside of North America and Europe, we face increased pressure to provide efficient, multilingual support. The vast majority of our community support is performed by third-party service providers, and our reliance on third-party service providers necessitates stringent guidance and quality control to maintain satisfactory service levels. Inadequate support or dispute resolution can harm our reputation and affect retention, leading to potential revenue reductions through refunds or coupons. The cost of maintaining robust community support is expected to rise, and efforts to reduce support requests may not offset these costs, materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we are unable to successfully expand our global network or manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are a global platform with hosts in more than 220 countries and regions and over 100,000 cities and towns, and we serve a global guest community. For the year ended December 31, 2024, 58% of our revenue was generated from listings outside of the United States. We expect to continue to make investments to expand our international operations; however, there can be no assurance that our international expansion efforts will be successful or result in revenue growth. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming, and expensive, and requires significant management attention and careful prioritization. As such, any international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to operational, tax, regulatory, and compliance risks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Increased operating expenses, decreased revenue, negative publicity, negative reaction from our hosts and guests and other stakeholders, or other adverse impacts from any of the risks related to our international operations could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on the value of our brand and traffic to our platform to grow revenue, and if we are unable to market our brand and drive traffic cost-effectively, it would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe maintaining and strengthening our brand is crucial for attracting and retaining hosts and guests. We invest significantly in brand marketing across various channels to drive traffic to our platform, but these efforts may not always be cost-effective or successful. Additionally, increased spending by competitors on brand marketing could hinder our ability to grow platform traffic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our marketing strategy includes performance marketing through search engines and social media, as well as paid and unpaid channels like search engine optimization (&#8220;SEO&#8221;). However, rising costs for keywords and changes in search engine algorithms can impact our visibility and increase customer acquisition costs. If we cannot effectively grow traffic without increasing performance marketing spend, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "SEO efforts are vulnerable to changes in search engine algorithms and consumer behavior, which can reduce our platform's prominence. If our listings are less visible, we may need to increase paid marketing, raising costs and affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If consumers become less reliant on search engines for travel searches and instead incorporate AI and machine learning and other channels, we may not be able to optimize for searches on these emerging channels and may risk losing traffic to competitors. Additionally, if major platforms like Google or Apple favor their own services or other partner services, our ability to engage users via mobile app or search could be impacted. \n",
      "\n",
      "As guests compare offerings across multiple sites, our marketing efficiency may decline, necessitating increased expenditures that may not yield additional revenue. Additionally, negative publicity or complaints could harm our reputation, reducing platform usage and requiring further marketing spend to recover traffic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Brand and Reputation Risks \n",
      "\n",
      "Host, guest, or third-party actions that are criminal, violent, inappropriate, dangerous, or fraudulent, may undermine the safety or the perception of safety on our platform and our ability to attract and retain hosts and guests and materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition . \n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot control or predict the actions of users and third parties, such as neighbors or invitees, during stays or experiences, including actions that may compromise the safety of hosts, guests, and others. Incidents involving alleged fatalities, injuries, sexual violence, fraud, privacy invasion, property damage, and discrimination have occurred and may occur in the future, potentially leading to legal liabilities and reputational damage. When a user is identity verified, it means that they provided information we validated through our process. In addition, we do not currently and may not in the future require users to re-verify their identity following their successful completion of the initial verification process. We conduct background checks for certain U.S. and Indian users and we screen users against sanctions watch lists, but these are not exhaustive due to regulatory, information, and frequency limitations. We do not verify all listings for safety or compliance, relying instead on user-reported issues, which may be incomplete or inaccurate. We have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to independently verify the safety, suitability, location, quality, compliance with Airbnb policies or standards, and legal compliance, such as fire code compliance or the presence of carbon monoxide detectors, hidden cameras or pool safety, of all our hosts&#8217; listings or experiences. We have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to independently verify the location, safety, or suitability of experiences for individual guests, the suitability, qualifications, or credentials of experiences hosts, or the qualifications of individual experiences guests. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have faced civil litigation, regulatory investigations, and inquiries involving allegations related to unsafe listings, discriminatory practices, and other misconduct. Despite efforts to enhance trust and safety, we may not fully succeed, impacting public perception and platform adoption. \n",
      "\n",
      "If hosts, guests, or third parties engage in criminal activity, misconduct, fraudulent, negligent, or inappropriate conduct, or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, we may receive negative media coverage, or be subject to involvement in a government investigation concerning such activity, which could adversely impact our brand and reputation, potentially leading consumers to think our platform and the listings on our platform are not safe, and lower the adoption rate of our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, certain regions where we operate have higher reported rates of violent crime or varying safety requirements, which can lead to more safety and security incidents, and may adversely impact the adoption of our platform in those regions and elsewhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, claims have been asserted against us from our hosts, guests, and third parties for compensation due to alleged fatalities, shootings, other violent acts, carbon monoxide incidents, hidden camera incidents, accidents, injuries, assaults, theft, property damage, data privacy and data security issues, fraudulent listings, and other incidents that are caused by other hosts, guests, or third parties while using our platform. These claims subject us to potentially significant liability and reputational damage, increase our operating costs and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have obtained some third-party insurance, which is subject to certain conditions and exclusions, for claims and losses incurred based on incidents related to bookings on our platform. Our insurance policies, which may or may not be applicable to all claims and may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all, may be inadequate to fully cover alleged claims of liability, investigation costs, defense costs, and/or payouts. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant time and cost investigating and defending against them. As we expand our offerings, or if the quantity or severity of incidents increases, our insurance rates and our financial exposure will grow, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "We track certain operational metrics, which are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our stock price, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We track operational metrics such as Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, Average Daily Rate (&#8220;ADR&#8221;), active listings, active bookers, hosts, guest arrivals, greenhouse gas emissions, and other ESG metrics, which may differ from third-party estimates due to varying methodologies and assumptions. Our internal systems have limitations, and changes in tracking methods could lead to unexpected metric variations. Errors in these systems may result in inaccurate data reporting. Metrics like Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV are adjusted for cancellations and alterations that happen in the reporting period, but such cancellations and alterations can occur beyond the reporting period and can affect future metrics. Calculating these operational metrics requires ongoing data collection on new offerings that are added to our platform over time. Our business is complex, and the methodology used to calculate these metrics may require adjustments to accurately represent the full value of new offerings. \n",
      "\n",
      "An active booker is a unique guest who has booked a stay or experience in a given time period. Certain individuals may have more than one guest account and therefore may be counted more than once in our count of active bookers. We count the number of hosts on our platform based on the number of hosts with an available listing as of a certain date. Some individuals may have more than one host account and therefore may be counted more than once as hosts. \n",

      "\n",
      "Our failure to properly manage funds held on behalf of customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We offer integrated payments in approximately 50 currencies to allow access to guest demand from more than 220 countries and regions and the ability for many hosts to be paid in their local currency or payment method of choice. When a guest books and pays for a stay or experience on our platform, we hold the total amount the guest has paid until check-in, at which time we recognize our service fee as revenue and initiate the process to remit the payment to the host, which generally occurs 24 hours after the scheduled check-in, barring any alterations or cancellations, which may result in funds being returned to the guest. Accordingly, at any given time, we hold on behalf of our hosts and guests a substantial amount of funds, which are generally held in bank deposit accounts and in U.S. government money market funds and recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to either safeguard customer funds in bankruptcy-remote bank accounts, or hold such funds in eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in such jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount held on behalf of customers. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the cash underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our platform and services, and result in significant penalties and fines from regulators, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The insurance coverage afforded by or available from our insurers may be inadequate for the needs of our business, and losses under our damage protection program could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to manage the exposures related to our business operations. We support our host community by maintaining a variety of host protection programs, such as AirCover for Hosts, which includes Host Liability Insurance, Experiences Liability Insurance, and our Host Damage Protection program. \n",
      "\n",
      "In relation to Airbnb&#8217;s insurance programs, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if (i) cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our expectations; (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits; (iii) our insurance providers become insolvent or otherwise fail to pay on our insurance claims; (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is denied by or disputed by our insurance providers; (v) claims costs exceed our captive insurance subsidiary&#8217;s forecast or reserves; or (vi) the number of claims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historic averages. Our spending for insurance has increased as our business has grown and losses from covered claims have increased. Premiums have increased as a result, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased difficulty in obtaining appropriate policy limits and levels of coverage at a reasonable cost and with reasonable terms and conditions. Our costs for obtaining these policies will continue to increase as our business grows and continues to evolve. Furthermore, as our business continues to develop and diversify, we may experience difficulty in obtaining insurance coverage for new and evolving offerings, which could require us to incur greater costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In relation to our Host Damage Protection program, which is a commercial guaranty agreement that provides reimbursement of up to $3 million for certain guest-caused loss or damages to a host property that are not reimbursed by the guest, we maintain a contractual liability insurance policy to provide coverage to us for losses incurred by us under the Host Damage Protection program. Increased frequency and severity and increased fraud could result in greater payouts, increased investigation costs, premium increases, and/or difficulty securing insurance coverage. \n",

If these third-party payment service providers become unavailable or if we are subject to increased fees, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on a number of third-party payment service providers, including payment card networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways, to link us to payment card and bank clearing networks to process payments made by our guests and to remit payments to hosts on our platform. If these providers, some of whom are the sole providers of their particular service, become unable or unwilling to offer services on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be disrupted, requiring us to find alternatives providers and they may not be able to be replaced in a timely manner, or at all, or on favorable terms. Transitioning to new providers would demand significant resources and might not be well-received by users, potentially leading to losses and necessitating payments to hosts from our funds, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the software and services from these providers may fail to meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised, or experience outages, all of which could impact our ability to process payments, make timely payments to hosts, or comply with regulatory requirements, which could deter users and harm our reputation, possibly leading to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, or enforcement action. Agreements with providers may even allow them to hold our cash as a reserve under certain conditions, such as adverse business changes, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, and such fees result in significant costs. Payment card networks may impose special fees or assessments on any transaction that accesses their network. Our payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees, assessments or special fees on to us. Such interchange and other fees may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. \n",
      "\n",
      "Credit card transactions result in higher fees to us than transactions made through debit cards. Any material increase in interchange fees in the United States or other geographies, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations imposed by law in some geographies, or other network fees or assessments, or a shift from payment with debit cards to credit cards among our guests could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, inadequate investment in our payment infrastructure could hinder functionality and competitiveness, affecting usage. Further, expanding our payment services into additional geographies or offering new methods may introduce additional regulations and fraud risks, which would increase operating expenses. \n",

      "If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses or be unable to process payment transactions. \n",

      "We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and other investments, including money market funds, certificates of deposit, U.S. government debt securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, government agency debt securities, mortgaged-backed and asset-backed securities, with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad for both our corporate balances and for funds held on behalf of our hosts and guests. We also rely on such banks and financial institutions to help process payments transactions. We have both significant funds flows from and to various financial institutions as a result of our processing of payments from guests to hosts. As part of our currency hedging activities on these balances, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and manage this exposure in an attempt to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition, or service interruptions at, or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets may be limited by the counterparty&#8217;s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, our ability to process payment transactions via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses and be required to make payments to hosts and/or refunds to guests out of our own funds, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

      "In March 2021, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the &#8220;2026 Notes&#8221;). In addition, on October 31, 2022, we entered into a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with $1.0 billion of initial commitments from a group of lenders (&#8220;2022 Credit Facility&#8221;). As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility, and we had total outstanding letters of credit of $19 million under the 2022 Credit Facility. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. \n",

Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, certain provisions of our 2026 Notes and related agreements could complicate or increase the cost for a third-party seeking to acquire us. Noteholders may require us to repurchase their notes for cash following a fundamental change, potentially straining our financial resources and leading to defaults under the indenture or other debt agreements. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the accounting treatment of the 2026 Notes as a liability and the use of the \"if-converted\" method for earnings per share calculations may negatively impact our reported financials. \n",

The covenants in the agreement governing our 2022 Credit Facility, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries&#8217; abilities to (i) incur additional indebtedness at subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the 2022 Credit Facility; (ii) create or incur additional liens; (iii) partake in sale/leaseback transactions; (iv) engage in certain fundamental changes, including mergers or consolidations; and (v) enter into negative pledge clauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions. \n",

      "The failure to successfully execute and integrate acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have acquired multiple businesses and we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, which indebtedness could result in restrictions on our business and significant use of available cash to make payments of interest and principal. In addition, we may finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could result in further dilution to our existing stockholders. We may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "In addition, we may not be successful in integrating acquisitions, or the businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. While our acquisitions to date have not caused major disruptions in our business, any future failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; difficulties in integrating and managing the combined operations, technology platforms, or offerings of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays, and failure to execute on the intended strategy and synergies; \n",

      "\n",
      "From time to time, we also make investments in private companies, which are inherently risky. To the extent our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we have recognized an expense to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value. Negative changes in the estimated fair value of private companies in which we invest could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

Adoption of a change in accounting principles or interpretations \n",

      "As we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel we need. The loss of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate employees required for the planned expansion of our business, would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition and impair our ability to grow. To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may be adversely affected by declines in our stock price. Additionally, if we issue significant equity to attract employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional stock-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. \n",

      "We have adopted a Live and Work Anywhere policy. The increase in remote working subjects us to certain operational challenges and could have adverse tax implications, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, we adopted our Live and Work Anywhere policy, which permits the majority of our employees to work remotely. Remote working subjects us to operational challenges and risks. For example, a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event may impact our employees&#8217; ability to work remotely. In addition, members of our workforce who work remotely may not have access to technology that is as robust as that in our offices, which could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to those remote workers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. We are also exposed to risks associated with the locations of remote workers, including compliance with local laws and regulations or exposure to compromised internet infrastructure. Allowing members of our workforce to work remotely creates intellectual property risk if employees create intellectual property on our behalf while residing in a jurisdiction with unenforced or uncertain intellectual property laws. Further, if employees fail to inform us of changes in their work location, we may unknowingly be exposed to additional risks. Remote working at our company (and at many third-party providers) also results in consumer, privacy, information technology and cybersecurity, and fraud risks due to the challenges associated with managing remote computing assets and security vulnerabilities that are present in many non-corporate and home networks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our transition to full or predominantly remote work environments also presents significant challenges to maintaining compliance with country and state requirements such as employee income tax withholding, the recording of reserves to cover withholding corrections or penalties, payroll tax remittance and reporting, payroll registration, and workers&#8217; compensation insurance. Additionally, foreign tax authorities may assert that certain of our entities have created permanent establishment in their countries , which could result in additional corporate income taxes and employee payroll withholding obligations. Any of these operational challenges or tax implications resulting from our Live and Work Anywhere policy may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

These unpredictable events can abruptly alter consumer travel behavior, reducing demand for our platform and services, and materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Climate change and other environmental or social pressures, as well as societal responses to same, may exacerbate or lead to additional impacts from such events. For more information, see our risk factor titled &#8220;We are subject to risks associated with the physical impacts of climate change as well as various efforts to transition to a low-carbon society.&#8221; \n",

      "Macroeconomic conditions, including economic downturns, inflation, tariffs, and currency fluctuations, also influence consumer discretionary spending, which is crucial for our business. Factors like unemployment, consumer debt, and financial market volatility can decrease consumer confidence and spending, particularly affecting leisure travel, which forms a substantial part of our business. Economic downturns have historically reduced travel spending, and future downturns could similarly decrease demand for our platform, leading to lower bookings, increased cancellations, and reduced revenue, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Hosts have numerous options for listing their spaces and experiences, both online and offline, and often cross-list their offerings. We compete for hosts based on factors like booking volume, platform usability, service fees, host protections, and brand and reputation. Guests also have various options \n",

      "Our competitors include OTAs, search engines, listing and meta-search websites, hotel chains, property management companies, and online experience platforms. Many competitors have advantages such as greater brand recognition, larger marketing budgets, and more resources. They may offer a more comprehensive product experience and respond more effectively to market changes. They may develop technological advancements that allow them to offer better products and services at a lower price. Failure to offer or deploy new technologies as effectively as our competitors could adversely affect our business. Industry consolidation and emerging start-ups further intensify competition, potentially impacting our growth and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous companies offer homes for booking, often cross-listed on multiple platforms, which can make our pricing appear less competitive for a number of reasons, including differences in fee structure and policies. Some property managers and hosts encourage direct bookings, bypassing our platform, which reduces our usage. Competitors with established consumer relationships may leverage these to enter the travel market, creating &#8220;super-apps&#8221; that integrate multiple services, potentially increasing our customer acquisition costs and affecting our competitive position. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also face competition from search engines like Google, which can influence search traffic and promote their own travel services, potentially disintermediating our platform.

For example, the physical impacts of climate change (which may include more frequent or severe storms, extreme weather events, extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, hurricanes, flooding, rising sea levels, shortages of water, droughts, wildfires, and natural disasters) may interrupt infrastructure on which our platform relies, impact demand or supply for lodging, or otherwise adversely impact our business. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of certain such events, as well as contribute to chronic changes (such as changes to meteorological and hydrological patterns) that may also impact the behaviors of guests and hosts or infrastructure on which we rely. \n",

      "Growing awareness of climate and other environmental or social pressures, including over-tourism, has also prompted responses by various actors in society, which may adversely impact the travel and hospitality industries and demand for our platform and services, whether due to the imposition of policies and regulations or changing societal attitudes towards travel. For example, both we and hosts are increasingly subject to regulatory requirements related to climate-related considerations, and any additional regulations may require increased costs or attention for compliance. Our platform and services may also be adversely impacted to the extent travel behavior or other societal expectations shift in response to climate considerations, including if we do not successfully navigate stakeholder expectations regarding our own response to climate change. \n",

      "In addition, we may not accurately forecast our results of operations due to timing differences between when bookings are made and revenue recognition, which occurs at check-in. For example, the effect of significant downturns in bookings in a particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods due to this timing difference. Our expense levels are based on revenue estimates that may be inaccurate, and fixed expenses may lead to greater-than-expected losses if revenue falls short. Incorrect assumptions or failure to address risks could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "\n",
      "Generally speaking, a strong U.S. dollar can negatively impact our revenue, as approximately 54% of our revenue in 2024 was in non-U.S. dollar currencies. We also face foreign exchange risk with certain assets, like cash balances held for hosts and guests, affecting our financial results through currency remeasurement and translation. Our platform allows guests to pay in their preferred currency, which may differ from the host's payment currency, leading to currency risk due to timing differences. \n",

      "We utilize a foreign exchange cash flow hedging program to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on our revenue. However, hedging may not fully mitigate losses, and our hedging positions may be incomplete or absent in the future.

      "We are subject to evolving global tax regimes, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;) introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax and an excise tax on stock repurchases. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we accrued approximately $95 million of corporate alternative minimum tax, and approximately $20 million of excise tax on stock repurchases. Additionally, the U.S. government may implement further changes, such as increasing the corporate income tax rate or altering the taxation of international income. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and states, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries and states where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. For example, in Italy, a law enacted in 2017 purports to require short-term rental platforms that process payments to withhold and remit host income tax and collect and remit tourist tax, amongst other obligations. In December 2023, without admitting any liability, Airbnb Ireland signed an agreement with the Italian Revenue Agency in settlement of the 2017-2021 audit periods for an aggregate payment of 576 million Euro ($621 million). Additionally, in December 2024, Airbnb Ireland signed a similar agreement in settlement of the 2022 audit period for an aggregate payment of 139 million Euro ($150 million). Such agreements settle a dispute about Airbnb Ireland&#8217;s obligations to withhold and remit host income tax, including taxes, interest, and penalties, for those relevant periods. Airbnb&#8217;s subsidiary in Italy and Airbnb Ireland continue to be, or could in the future be, subject to tax audits in Italy, including in relation to permanent establishment, transfer pricing, withholding obligations, and tourist taxes. Such audits could result in the imposition of additional potentially significant prior and future tax obligations. \n",

      "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the &#8220;OECD&#8221;) is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years as a result of these changes. \n",
      "\n",
      "The European Commission is also conducting investigations into preferential tax treatments, which may lead to changes in how our foreign operations are taxed. As our international business expands, these developments could raise our effective tax rate and non-income tax obligations, materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial conditions. Additionally, some changes may apply retroactively, leading to unexpected tax liabilities beyond our current estimates. \n",
      "\n",
      "We may have exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and determine the value of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including those of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation, and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Airbnb. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

      "We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. For example, our 2008 to 2024 tax years remain subject to examination in the United States and California due to tax attributes and statutes of limitations, and our 2020 to 2024 tax years remain subject to examination in Ireland. We are currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) for the years 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2018. We are continuing to respond to inquiries related to these examinations. In December 2020, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (&#8220;NOPA&#8221;) from the IRS for the 2013 tax year relating to the valuation of our international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. The notice proposed an increase to our U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of $1.3 billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $1.0 billion. We disagree with the proposed adjustment and intend to vigorously contest it. In January 2022, we entered into an administrative dispute process with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (&#8220;IRS Appeals&#8221;) regarding the proposed adjustment. An acceptable outcome was not reached with IRS Appeals, and in May 2024, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (&#8220;Notice&#8221;) from the IRS related to the aforementioned valuation of our international intellectual property. The Notice claims that we owe $1.3 billion in tax, plus penalties and interest. We will continue to pursue all available remedies to resolve this dispute. In July 2024, we petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (&#8220;Tax Court&#8221;) for redetermination, and if necessary, we will appeal the Tax Court&#8217;s decision to the \n",

      "appropriate appellate court. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position and such tax and related interest and penalties, if any, exceeds our current reserves, such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations, and any assessment of additional tax could require a significant cash payment and have a material adverse impact on our cash flow. \n",

      "Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "We face complex and evolving tax obligations across various jurisdictions, which could significantly impact our business. We are subject to numerous taxes, including income and indirect taxes, and have received demands from governments for data to enforce tax laws against our hosts and guests. We collect and remit taxes on behalf of hosts when legally required, but disputes and lawsuits over tax responsibilities persist. New or revised tax laws could increase our tax liabilities and operational costs, potentially leading to penalties for non-compliance. \n",
      "\n",
      "The application of indirect taxes, such as lodging taxes, transactional taxes, hotel, sales and use tax, privilege taxes, excise taxes, VAT, goods and services tax, digital services taxes, harmonized sales taxes, business tax, and gross receipt taxes (together, &#8220;indirect taxes&#8221;) to e-commerce activities such as ours and to our hosts or guests is a complex and evolving issue. These taxes could raise costs for hosts and guests, discourage platform use, and reduce revenue. For example, we recorded approximately $53 million in expense related to digital service taxes relating to prior periods as a result of refining our interpretation of the law as it applies to us. Additionally, we recorded $18 million of lodging tax expense in a particular jurisdiction over uncertainty as to how a new law applies to us. Compliance with tax reporting may require disclosing personal data, risking privacy concerns and regulatory actions. Competitors may adopt different tax strategies, potentially attracting our hosts and guests. \n",
      "\n",
      "We devote significant resources, including management time, to the application and interpretation of laws and working with various jurisdictions to clarify whether taxes are applicable and the amount of taxes that apply. Rapid regulatory changes and lack of uniformity complicate compliance, risking errors and enforcement actions. As our business evolves, tax obligations may increase, further affecting our financial condition and platform usage. \n",

      "Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. \n",
      "\n",
      "While federal net operating loss carryforwards generated on or after January 1, 2018 are not subject to expiration, the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforwards is limited to 80% of our taxable income for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that some of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future taxable income, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation&#8217;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change taxable income or income tax liabilities may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable income or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us. \n",

Such laws and regulations are complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and have limited and may continue to limit the ability or willingness of new or existing hosts to share their spaces through our platform. These regulations may expose our users or us to regulatory inquiries, litigation, and/or other disputes and to potentially significant liabilities, including taxes, compliance costs, fines, and criminal or other penalties, which have had and could continue to have a material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Hosts list, and guests search for, stays and experiences on our platform in more than 220 countries and regions across the globe. There are national, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations in jurisdictions that relate to or affect our business and, since we began our operations in 2008, there have been and continue to be legal and regulatory developments and inconsistent or ambiguous interpretations among local, regional, or national laws or regulations that affect the short-term rental, experiences, long-term rental, and home sharing business. These laws and regulations may impact the ability of hosts to list properties entirely and/or may limit the location and/or duration of stays permitted, or may establish other conditions upon which they are allowed to host. In addition, regulations may require that we, rather than local, state or national regulatory enforcement agencies, limit hosts&#8217; ability to list within those requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Compliance Costs \n",
      "\n",
      "Compliance with diverse and evolving laws across jurisdictions is costly and complex, increasing our operational expenses and potential liabilities (including potential criminal or other penalties). For example, we incur significant operational costs to comply with requirements of jurisdictions and cities that have disparate requirements around tax collection, tax reporting, data sharing, host registration, limits on lengths of stays, and other regulations, each of which may require us to dedicate significant resources to provide the infrastructure and tools needed on our platform for our hosts to meet these legal requirements and for us to fulfill any obligations we may have. Environmental, health, and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs, and our hosts&#8217; costs, to comply with such requirements may increase as a result. The complexity of our platform and changes required to comply with the large number of varying \n",
      "\n",
      "requirements can lead to constraints on supply as well as compliance gaps. Additionally, unclear and changing laws can deter hosts and guests from using our platform, reduce supply and demand, and increase litigation risks, adversely affecting our business. Failure or delays in complying with laws, even if unclear or in dispute, could subject us to penalties, including fines, business disruption and site blocking. \n",
      "\n",
      "We require hosts and guests to comply with all applicable legal obligations under our terms of service, but governments may nonetheless seek to hold us accountable for hosts&#8217; and guests&#8217; compliance. This can lead to penalties and costs that impact our reputation and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our compliance measures, such as requiring hosts to include registration numbers for listings in some jurisdictions, may increase platform friction and reduce listings and bookings. Host listings may also be limited by night caps, density restrictions, onerous permitting requirements, primary residence or host presence requirements, permit caps, minimum night stays, and/or discretionary permitting or lottery systems. Additional regulations could necessitate significant platform changes, discouraging use and increasing scrutiny and liability. \n",

Violation of these laws could subject the company to fines and penalties, including in some cases, criminal penalties. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regulatory Developments \n",
      "\n",
      "Hotels and groups affiliated with hotels have engaged and will likely continue to engage in various lobbying and political efforts for stricter regulations governing our business in both local and national jurisdictions. Additionally, private groups, such as homeowners and neighborhood associations, may adopt contracts or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict the ability of hosts to list their spaces. In some jurisdictions, regulations imposing restrictions on short-term rentals are increasingly fragmented at the local level, leading to increased compliance burden. These efforts, along with existing and potential new laws, could restrict short-term rentals, impose registration requirements and other limits to hosts&#8217; ability to list, and lead to significant fines and liabilities, materially affecting our platform's operations and financial condition. For instance, EU Member State laws pertaining to the recently enacted EU STR Regulation will require additional compliance efforts, potentially discouraging and prohibiting current and potential hosts from listing properties. As another example, the City of New York has effectively banned short-term rentals, and this has led to similar restrictions being considered throughout the State of New York. If other geographies emulate these regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We face ongoing disputes with government agencies over regulations, which may result in fines and operational changes. Some jurisdictions have imposed or may seek to impose taxes and licensing requirements on our platform and failure to comply could lead to penalties. We have resolved some disputes by agreeing to remove listings or share data with authorities. From time to time, we attempt to defend against application of laws and regulations that limit hosts&#8217; or guests&#8217; ability or willingness to list and search for accommodations, but have sometimes been and may continue to be unsuccessful in certain of those efforts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Increased regulatory interest in technology companies, particularly regarding AI, data privacy, competition, and sustainability, could lead to further compliance challenges. New or changing laws could impose significant costs and liabilities, affecting our business operations and financial condition. Our attempts to influence legislation face uncertainty and may divert resources from core operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regulatory Inquiries, Litigation &#38; Disputes \n",
      "\n",
      "We are frequently involved in legal and regulatory claims, including government inquiries and litigation related to short-term rentals, taxes, consumer protection, payment services, insurance, and data privacy. These proceedings are complex, costly, and time-consuming, requiring significant resources and potentially leading to fines, penalties, and operational changes. As our business grows, the number and complexity of these claims are expected to increase, potentially impacting our brand and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We face litigation, inquiries, investigations, audits, and proceedings with governments and other entities over regulations affecting short-term rentals and platform liability. Changes in legal interpretations could further impact our operations. Additionally, we are subject to claims related to incidents at listings, such as personal injuries, cancellations and refunds, and privacy violations, as well as class action lawsuits and government inquiries. If we become more involved in hosts&#8217; listings and conduct related to bookings, then we are more likely to draw scrutiny and additional regulations from governments and undercut various defenses we may have to claims or attempts to regulate us, which further constrain our business and impose additional liability on us as a platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as U.S. laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&#8220;DMCA&#8221;), the Stored Communications Act, and the Communications Decency Act (&#8220;CDA&#8221;), and non-U.S. laws such as the Digital Services Act (&#8220;DSA&#8221;), the EU STR Regulation, and the European E-Commerce Directive and their national transpositions are interpreted by the courts or if they are otherwise modified or amended, as our platform and services to our hosts and guests continue to expand, and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also face intellectual property disputes and indemnification obligations, which could lead to further litigation. In addition, compliance with escheatment laws and audits could result in additional liabilities and impact our financial results. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may result in significant financial penalties, changes to business practices, increased costs and reputational damage. Litigation diverts resources and may not be fully covered by our existing insurance policies, which may not be available to us on financially reasonable terms in the future or at all. Additionally, if we enter an agreement with a government or governmental agency to resolve a dispute, the terms of such agreement may be publicly available and could create a precedent that may lead to similar disputes in other jurisdictions and may put us in a weaker bargaining position in future disputes with other governments. As we expand, we anticipate continued legal challenges that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We offer travel insurance products to guests, which subject us and our business to extensive laws, regulations, and supervision. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since June 2022, guests in certain jurisdictions have had the opportunity to purchase travel insurance when they make a booking. Over time, we expect to make travel insurance available to guests in additional countries. In the United States, travel insurance products are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which we transact business by state insurance departments. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of consumers. States have also adopted legislation defining and prohibiting unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts and practices in the business of insurance that may apply to insurance agencies. Noncompliance with any of such state statutes may subject us to regulatory action by the relevant state insurance regulator, and, in certain states, private litigation. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that any new laws, rules, or regulations, or unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules or regulations, may have on our business and financial results. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and independent agents. State insurance regulators may also conduct periodic examinations, the results of which could give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action. Similarly, travel insurance products are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the applicable regulators in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the European Union. The failure to comply with applicable state and foreign laws and regulations could result in fines, investigations and/or civil or criminal proceedings against us by governmental agencies and/or consumers which, if material, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, insurance carriers with which we place business are subject to regulations, which may affect how we conduct our operations. We may need to expend resources to address questions or concerns regarding our relationships with these insurers and underwriters, diverting resources away from operating our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

As we expand further, we face varying and sometimes conflicting legal obligations. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in one jurisdiction may be prohibited by sanctions, AML, CTF, or other regulations in a different jurisdiction. We regularly assess our compliance programs and may identify gaps requiring costly enhancements to our policies and controls. \n",
      "\n",
      "Non-compliance or perceived failure to comply with these existing or new laws and regulations, including changes to or expansion of their interpretations, can lead to significant fines, lawsuits, regulatory and/or governmental investigations, enforcement actions, loss of required licenses and other civil and criminal penalties, forcing us to alter operations or delay product launches, adversely affecting our brand, business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects. The complexity of global regulations may trigger overlapping investigations by multiple authorities, impacting our relationships with financial institutions.

This means that APLux will need to undertake a detailed impact assessment to the required uplifts to existing policies and procedures. This will likely result in material changes to the day to day AML and CTF operating procedures of APLux and material divergence between the AML and CTF rules applicable to APUK in the UK and those applicable to APLux, bringing with it increased costs and the regulatory enforcement risks (such as fines, censures and potentially the suspension or removal of regulatory licenses or controls placed on APLux&#8217;s ability to onboard new customers) associated with designing compliance with a nascent regime. \n",

      "ESG matters are an area of growing and evolving focus among our shareholders and other stakeholders, including customers, employees, regulators, politicians, and the general public in the United States and abroad. Companies like Airbnb face heightened expectations regarding matters such as environmental sustainability, diversity, human rights, and data privacy. We engage in various initiatives to serve our stakeholders in these and other areas, and to respond to stakeholder expectations regarding ESG, but such initiatives can be costly and may not have the desired effect. For example, many ESG initiatives (including related metrics and targets) are based on methodologies, standards, and data that are still evolving or are subject to variable interpretation; as with other companies, our approach to such matters evolves, and we cannot guarantee that our approach, either now or in future, will align with the expectations or preferences of any particular stakeholder or that certain disclosures will not be considered erroneous or subject to misinterpretation. \n",

      "The regulatory landscape for ESG issues is also rapidly evolving, and various policymakers, including the European Union and State of California, among others, have adopted (or are considering adopting) requirements for climate- or other ESG-related disclosures or other actions. We may face risks related to sustainability reporting obligations under the evolving regulatory landscape in the European Union. Specifically, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (&#8220;CSRD&#8221;) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (&#8220;CSDDD&#8221;) impose stringent requirements on companies to disclose detailed information regarding their ESG practices. Furthermore, the transposition of the CSRD by EU member states will also impact the scope of these requirements. Many member states have not yet transposed the directive, adding another layer of uncertainty to compliance efforts. Additionally, the EU's Omnibus Simplification Package introduces further complexity and uncertainty in the European Union. Compliance involves significant expenses and resources, with risks of errors in implementing necessary changes. These requirements are not uniform, and may not be interpreted or applied uniformly, which may increase the cost and complexity of compliance, as well as any related risks. Various of our suppliers and other stakeholders are subject to similar risks, which may exacerbate, or create additional, risks on such matters. \n",

      "Data privacy, data security, AI, marketing and consumer protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and rapidly evolving and we could be materially adversely affected by new legal requirements or changes to existing requirements including their interpretations and enforcement practices. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data processing practices, potentially increasing compliance costs or adversely affecting our business. We process personal data, such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, nationality, location information, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, and identity verification information (for example, government issued identification or passport), as well as credit card, bank account or other financial information, from and about hosts and guests, as well as our employees, job applicants, contractors and representatives of our third-party vendors, and other companies we do business with. We utilize third-party vendors, some of whom process data for us and provide various services, including but not limited to digital storage technology, business technology support, and other support functions. We and our vendors must comply with various state, federal, and foreign data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements, including those that generally require that we implement reasonable measures to keep such information secure and otherwise restrict the ways in which such information can be collected and used.

      "Additionally, we note that as the use of AI and machine learning technologies (&#8220;AI and ML Technologies&#8221;) continues to grow, regulators (including data protection regulators) are expected to take an increased interest in issues, such as how we and our vendors collect, maintain and process and provide transparency on the use of personal data of our users and/ or hosts in that context. Our technology platform incorporates the use of AI and ML Technologies, for example, for fraud detection, search, enabling customized features and enhancing community support. Enhanced scrutiny of the use of AI and ML Technologies means that regulators may increasingly seek advance engagement with businesses like ours in respect of certain types of data processing. In addition, certain existing legal regimes, including those relating to data privacy and consumer protection, regulate certain aspects of AI and ML Technologies, and new laws regulating AI and ML Technologies have been or may be enacted or have entered into force in jurisdictions that we operate. This may affect our use of AI and ML Technologies and our ability to provide, improve or commercialize our services effectively and efficiently and result in increased costs. For example, in the United States, California enacted seventeen new laws in 2024 that further regulate the use of AI and ML Technologies and provide consumers with additional protections around companies&#8217; use of AI and ML Technologies, such as requiring companies to disclose certain uses of generative AI. Other states have also passed AI-focused legislation, such as Colorado&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Act, which will require developers and deployers of &#8220;high-risk&#8221; AI systems to implement certain safeguards against algorithmic discrimination, and Utah&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, which establishes disclosure requirements and accountability measures for the use of generative AI in certain consumer interactions. Other legislation has been introduced or proposed at the federal and state level, and there remains uncertainty at the federal level regarding the regulation of AI and ML Technologies. Further, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (the &#8220;EU AI Act&#8221;) entered into force in August 2024, and establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market. The majority of the substantive requirements will apply from August 2026. The EU AI Act applies to companies that develop, use and/or provide AI in the EU and &#8211; depending on the AI use case &#8211; includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose AI and foundation models, and fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover. These regulations may impact our ability to use, procure and commercialize AI and ML Technologies in the future, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our products or services, including if the laws are not consistent across jurisdictions. \n",

The GDPR comprehensively regulates our use of personal data, including cross-border transfers of personal data out of Europe. Many large geographies in which we operate, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, and South Korea have passed or are in the process of passing comparable or other robust data privacy and security legislation or regulation, which may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. \n",

      "In relation to cross-border transfers of personal data outside of Europe, we expect the existing legal complexity and uncertainty regarding international personal data transfers to continue. In particular, the European Commission approval of the current EU-US Data Privacy Framework for data transfers to certified entities in the United States may be challenged, which could also lead to challenges to, or impact the effectiveness of, other data transfer mechanisms such as the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism). In general, we expect that international transfers to the United States and to other jurisdictions more generally to continue to be subject to enhanced scrutiny by regulators and we cannot guarantee the ongoing efficacy of our data transfer mechanisms. It is also possible that transfers of personal data outside the United States could be restricted or impacted by developments at the federal level. As the regulatory guidance and enforcement landscape in relation to data transfers continue to develop, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, and/or regulatory investigations or fines, we may have to stop using certain tools and vendors and make other operational changes, including updating agreements or implementing additional safeguards which could otherwise affect the manner in which we provide our services, our ability to provide our services and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "In the United States, there are numerous federal and state data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, maintenance, disclosure and processing of personal data, including federal and state data privacy laws, data breach notification laws, electronic communications laws, and marketing and consumer protection laws. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and state regulators enforce a variety of data privacy issues, such as misrepresentations in privacy policies or failures to appropriately protect information about individuals, as unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of the FTC Act or similar state laws. Additionally, the GLBA and its implementing regulations, restrict and impose certain requirements on the processing of personal data, including notice to individuals of privacy practices and requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal data. Moreover, as we send marketing messages via email and short message service, or SMS, text messages, we are subject to the CAN-SPAM Act, which imposes certain obligations regarding the content of emails and providing and honoring opt-outs, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which imposes restrictions on the ability to send text messages without prior consent. \n",

In addition, numerous states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the processing of state residents&#8217; personal data that have and may continue to require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur related costs and expenses. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;) provides enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording residents the right to access and delete their data and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal data. The CCPA imposes a range of other compliance obligations and imposes severe statutory damages, which could lead to injunctive relief or agreed settlements providing for ongoing audit and reporting requirements, as well as a private right of action, for certain data breaches. This private right of action has increased the risks associated with data breach litigation. The enactment of the CCPA prompted a wave of similar legislative developments in other states, which creates a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. For example, since the CCPA went into effect, comprehensive privacy statutes that share similarities with the CCPA are now in effect and enforceable in other states. Many other states have passed or proposed similar laws and there remains increased interest at the federal level as well. \n",

      "Further, the majority of the substantive provisions of the DSA took effect in February 2024. The DSA governs, among other things, our potential liability for illegal services/products or content on our platform, obligations around traceability of business users, and requires enhanced transparency measures. In particular our obligations to diligence the services offered on our platform could require significant additional resources. Further, the DSA contains general requirements that user interfaces may not deceive or manipulate users which are yet to be clarified further by guidance. The DSA may increase our compliance costs, require changes to our user interfaces, processes, operations, and business practices which may adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and provide our services to customers, and may otherwise adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with the DSA can result in fines of up to 6% of total annual worldwide turnover and recipients of services have the right to seek compensation from providers in respect of damage or loss suffered due to infringement by the provider to comply with the DSA. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the Online Safety Act 2023, or the OSA, establishes an extensive regulatory framework for certain user-to-user and search services and imposes obligations to protect users from illegal content which, if applicable, may increase compliance costs and may otherwise adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with the OSA can result in fines of up to 10% of total annual worldwide turnover or &#163;18 million (whichever is greater). \n",

      "Various other governments and consumer agencies around the world have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically. Together, these existing and proposed laws add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources to compliance programs and cybersecurity, which could impact strategies, and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. Compliance with numerous and often contradictory requirements of different jurisdictions is particularly difficult for an online business such as ours, which collects personal information from hosts, guests, and other individuals in multiple jurisdictions. If any jurisdiction in which we operate adopts new laws or changes its interpretation of its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or localization such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we could risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. As in many cases these laws are relatively new and the interpretation and application of these laws is uncertain. There may be litigation, claims and enforcement relating to data privacy, and the processing of personal data may involve new interpretations of privacy laws. For example, there has been a noticeable increase in class actions in the United States where plaintiffs have utilized a variety of laws, including state wiretapping laws, in relation to the use of tracking technologies, such as cookies and pixels. \n",

For example, as we are subject to both the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, we could be fined under each regime independently in respect of the same breach. Penalties for certain breaches are up to the greater of &#8364;20 million or &#163;17.5 million, or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. \n",

We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation, injunctive relief, or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, and diversion of internal resources or other regulatory orders adversely impacting the ways our business can use personal data. These proceedings could be costly to litigate, whether or not they have merit, and result in negative publicity and erode trust, potentially requiring us to make costly changes to our business practices.

We own and manage some of these IT Systems but also rely on third-party IT Systems for certain operations, including payment processing and accounting. Significant consumer growth or third-party failures may require costly upgrades, potentially affecting our business, and if our systems and network infrastructure cannot be expanded or are not scaled to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience significant operational interruptions, including poor performance, incorrect payments, search ranking issues, unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, and delays in the introduction of new offerings, decreased customer satisfaction, and loss of users. Our reliance on the Internet and mobile networks could also lead to disruptions in access. Our IT Systems, including those from third-party providers, are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters. For example, our San Francisco operations are at risk from earthquakes and power outages, which could disrupt business operations.

If any such third-party AI and ML Technologies become incompatible with our offerings or unavailable for use or have degradations in performance, or if the providers of such models unfavorably change the terms on which their AI and ML Technologies are offered or terminate their relationship with us, our solutions may become less appealing to our customers. In addition, to the extent any third-party AI and ML Technologies are used as a vendor hosted service, any disruption, outage, or loss of information through such hosted services could disrupt our operations or solutions, damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our solutions, or result in legal claims or proceedings, for which we may be unable to recover damages from the affected provider. \n",

      "The regulatory and intellectual property frameworks governing the use and protection of AI and ML Technologies and of its outputs are rapidly evolving, and we cannot predict how future legislation and regulation will impact our ability to offer and protect products or services that we develop which leverage AI and ML Technologies. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or proposed additional laws and regulations. Additionally, existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect the operation of and availability of IP protection for our AI and ML Technologies. As a result, implementation standards, enforcement practices, and available scope of protection are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, or standards may have on our business (including our positioning with respect to our competition) and may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these laws or regulations. Already, certain existing legal regimes (e.g., relating to data privacy) regulate certain aspects of AI and ML Technologies, and new laws regulating AI and ML Technologies are expected to continue to be proposed and enacted in the United States and globally. For further information related to AI laws and regulations that may affect our business, see the risk factor titled &#8220;Compliance with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to data privacy, data security, artificial intelligence, marketing and consumer protection involves significant expenditure and resources, and any actual or perceived failure by us or our vendors to comply may result in significant liability, litigation or other legal action against us, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and/or result in regulatory scrutiny, fines and penalties and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.&#8221; \n",

Our platform relies upon content that is created and posted by hosts, guests, or other third parties. Although content on our platform is typically generated by third parties, and not by us, claims of defamation, disparagement, negligence, warranty, personal harm, intellectual property infringement, or other alleged damages could be asserted against us, in addition to our hosts and guests. While we rely on legal exemptions and protections like the DMCA and CDA in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in the European Union, varying laws and interpretations regarding immunity and responsibility across jurisdictions may limit these exemptions or defenses or create uncertainty regarding liability for information or content uploaded by hosts, guests, or other third parties. To the extent that Airbnb creates or is deemed to create or facilitate such content on the platform, these defenses may be less available. New regulations could increase our liability and compliance costs, impacting our business. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, changes to the CDA could reduce protections for online platforms. In the EU, the DSA and Digital Markets Act (&#8220;DMA&#8221;) introduced new compliance requirements and potential fines. Other regions, like Asia and Latin America, have or are developing regulations that could impose direct or secondary liability on platforms for harmful content. These laws may require us to implement costly measures to mitigate liability, affecting our platform's appeal and our brand reputation. \n",

While these initiatives are crucial for community trust, they can increase platform friction, potentially reducing host and guest activity and materially adversely affecting our business. These trust and safety efforts, including limited verification of hosts and listings and restrictions on certain types of bookings, our neighborhood hotline, or other initiatives, incur significant costs and may lead to fewer listings and bookings. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a global platform, the implementation of these measures varies by region and may be limited by local laws. Despite our investments, we cannot guarantee these measures will be successful, significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on or off our platform, or be sufficient to protect our reputation in the event of such activity. Additionally, our community standards, including commitments to inclusion and belonging that are required when a user joins Airbnb, may not always be clearly communicated or well understood by all parts of our community, leading to unmet expectations among hosts and guests, which may lead to fewer listings and bookings. \n",

When hosts do not fulfill their obligations to guests, there are fictitious listings or fraudulent bookings on our platform, or there are host account takeovers, we have incurred and will continue to incur losses from claims by hosts and guests, and these losses may be substantial. Such instances have and can lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings, referred to as a &#8220;chargeback.&#8221; For the year ended December 31, 2024, total chargeback expense was $96 million. The capabilities of criminal fraudsters and the susceptibility of individuals to fraud pose ongoing risks. Despite measures to detect and reduce fraud, these efforts require continuous improvement to address evolving threats, especially with new payment methods and technology platforms. \n",

In addition, the use of third-party open-source software could expose us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software to the extent open-source licensors do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software equivalent to those provided by third-party commercial software providers. We also license to others some of our software through open-source projects. Open sourcing our own software requires us to make the source code publicly available, and therefore can limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to that software. From time to time, companies that use open-source software have faced claims challenging the use of open-source software or compliance with open-source license terms. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or claiming noncompliance with open-source licensing terms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inadvertent use of open-source software can occur in software development in the Internet and technology industries. Such inadvertent use of open source software could expose us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of the underlying licenses, which could lead to unforeseen business disruptions, including being restricted from offering parts of our platform which incorporate the software, being required to publicly release proprietary source code, being required to re-engineer parts of our code base to comply with license terms, or being required to extract the open source software at issue. Our exposure to these risks may be increased as a result of evolving our core source code base, introducing new offerings, integrating acquired-company technologies, or making other business changes, including in areas where we do not currently compete.

As we expand our technology use and collaborate with third parties, managing these threats becomes more challenging. These risks come from diverse threat actors, such as state-sponsored organizations, opportunistic hackers and hacktivists, as well as through diverse attack vectors, such as social engineering/phishing, malware (including ransomware), malfeasance by company insiders, suppliers or providers, and human or technological error, and as a result of malicious code embedded in open-source software, or misconfigurations, bugs, or other vulnerabilities in software and hardware that is integrated into our or our providers&#8217; IT Systems, products or services.

Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques&#8212;including AI&#8212;that circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove forensic evidence, which means that we and our third-party providers may be unable to detect, investigate, contain or recover from future attacks or incidents in a timely or effective manner. Despite significant investments in security, we cannot fully mitigate these risks, and such security incidents could disrupt operations and lead to negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of users, increased support costs, regulatory fines, legal claims (including class actions), and significant financial losses, especially under laws which impose statutory damages per breached record, all of which could materially impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

There can be no assurance that our service providers will anticipate or prevent all types of attacks or that any security measures will be effective against all types of cybersecurity threats and risks. Our service providers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events, and they may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, each of which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail to or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our platform and services, increase prices, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give preferential treatment to our competitors. If we are unable to procure alternatives in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be subject to business disruptions, losses, or costs to remediate any of these deficiencies and reputational harm.

Because the Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), is not convertible into any other capital stock, and is not listed for trading on an exchange or registered for sale with the SEC, shares of Class C common stock may be less liquid and less attractive to any future recipients of these shares than shares of Class A common stock, although we may seek to list the Class C common stock for trading and register shares of Class C common stock for sale in the future. In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, the holders of our Class B common stock, including our founders who are parties to a Nominating Agreement and a Voting Agreement, may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us that stockholders may otherwise support, and could allow us to take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, such issuances would have a dilutive effect on the economic interests of our Class A and Class B common stock. Any such issuance of Class C common stock could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. \n",

      "We may raise additional capital in the future or otherwise issue equity, which could have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If we require additional funding to support our business, this additional funding may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "We may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock, including as consideration for any future acquisitions. As a result, our stockholders may experience immediate dilution. We may engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, our stockholders will experience additional dilution when option holders exercise their right to purchase common stock under our equity incentive plans, when RSUs vest and settle, when we issue equity awards to our employees under our equity incentive plans, or when we otherwise issue additional equity. Additionally, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "There has been increased volatility in the financial and securities markets, which has generally made access to capital less certain and increased the cost of obtaining new capital. Should we require additional funding, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our ability to continue to support our business and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "The multi-series structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain holders of our common stock, including our directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders, and their respective affiliates. This ownership limits or precludes other stockholders&#8217; ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, our Class C common stock has no votes per share, and our Class H common stock has no votes per share. Because of the 20-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively continue to control a significant percentage of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until all such outstanding shares of Class B common stock have converted into shares of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, our founders, who collectively hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, are party to a Voting Agreement under which each founder and his affiliates and certain other entities agree to vote their shares for the election of each individual founder to our board of directors. We and each of our founders are party to a Nominating Agreement under which we and the founders are required to take certain actions to include the founders in the slate of nominees nominated by our board of directors for the applicable class of directors, include them in our proxy statement, and solicit proxies or consents in favor of electing each founder to our board of directors. This concentrated control limits or precludes other stockholders&#8217; ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major \n",

      "corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that stockholders may believe are in their best interest. \n",
      "\n",
      "Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes or transfers among our founders, if all of our founders agree to such transfers. Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Class B holder into one share of Class A common stock. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result, it is possible that one or more of the persons or entities holding our Class B common stock could gain significant voting control as other holders of Class B common stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into Class A common stock. In addition, the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock dilutes holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. In addition, any future issuances of common stock would be dilutive to holders of Class A common stock. For example, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. Further, each outstanding share of Class H common stock will convert into a share of Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis upon the sale of such share of Class H common stock to any person or entity that is not our subsidiary, which would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. \n",

Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), from bringing such claims in federal court to the extent that the Exchange Act confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable law. \n",

If a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act. \n",

      " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our Class A common stock. The following material factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors, and oral statements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Risks Related to Our Business and Operations \n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue and Growth Risks \n",
      "\n",
      "We may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate or effectively manage growth or new opportunities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our future revenue growth depends on the growth of supply and demand for listings on our platform and the development and adoption of new offerings and initiatives. Our business is also affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide as well as trends in the global travel and hospitality industries and the short and long-term accommodation regulatory landscape. A softening of supply or demand for our current or future offerings, whether caused by events outside of our control, challenging macroeconomic and political conditions, changes in host and guest preferences, public health crises such as pandemics, and any of the other factors described in these Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or otherwise, may result in decreased revenue and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we fail to retain or add hosts and guests, if hosts fail to provide high-quality stays and experiences, if our new offerings and initiatives are unsuccessful, or if our community support offerings are inadequate, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business success is heavily reliant on both hosts and guests engaging with our platform. Hosts must maintain and enhance their listings by offering a variety of desirable, competitively priced, and high-quality stays and experiences, while providing exceptional hospitality and timely responses to guest inquiries. These factors are largely outside our direct control, and if hosts fail to meet these expectations, or if they choose to cross-list or list exclusively with competitors, or if we are unable to attract and retain hosts in a cost-effective manner, or at all, our revenue and business operations could be adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our ability to attract and retain guests is crucial and can be impacted by external factors such as pandemics, political instability, climate change, and economic downturns, as well as internal factors like competition, brand perception, and platform usability. Additionally, our brand and reputation are critical to our success, as they influence our ability to attract and retain hosts, guests, and employees. Any negative perceptions or incidents related to safety, security, or quality could harm our public image and business operations. Issues such as unreliable reviews, regulatory scrutiny, or negative media coverage can further damage trust within our community, materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to invest in the development of new offerings and initiatives, including innovations focused on improving our host and guest experiences; however, developing and delivering these new offerings and initiatives increase our expenses and our organizational complexity, and we may experience difficulties in developing and implementing these new offerings and initiatives. Our new offerings and initiatives have a high degree of risk, as they may involve unproven businesses with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience. There can be no assurance that our hosts and guests will adopt or respond positively to such offerings and initiatives, that we will be able to successfully manage the development and delivery of such offerings and initiatives, or that any of these offerings or initiatives will help attract and retain users on our platform and gain sufficient market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset associated expenses or liabilities. If our new offerings and initiatives are not successful, or if we fail to provide a seamless and satisfactory experience for both hosts and guests, or if our host protection programs, including those provided through AirCover for hosts, become ineffective, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, our growth relies on delivering high-quality support to our community, which requires significant investment in staffing, technology, infrastructure, and training. As our global customer base expands, particularly outside of North America and Europe, we face increased pressure to provide efficient, multilingual support. The vast majority of our community support is performed by third-party service providers, and our reliance on third-party service providers necessitates stringent guidance and quality control to maintain satisfactory service levels. Inadequate support or dispute resolution can harm our reputation and affect retention, leading to potential revenue reductions through refunds or coupons. The cost of maintaining robust community support is expected to rise, and efforts to reduce support requests may not offset these costs, materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we are unable to successfully expand our global network or manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are a global platform with hosts in more than 220 countries and regions and over 100,000 cities and towns, and we serve a global guest community. For the year ended December 31, 2024, 58% of our revenue was generated from listings outside of the United States. We expect to continue to make investments to expand our international operations; however, there can be no assurance that our international expansion efforts will be successful or result in revenue growth. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming, and expensive, and requires significant management attention and careful prioritization. As such, any international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to operational, tax, regulatory, and compliance risks. \n",

      "We believe maintaining and strengthening our brand is crucial for attracting and retaining hosts and guests. We invest significantly in brand marketing across various channels to drive traffic to our platform, but these efforts may not always be cost-effective or successful. Additionally, increased spending by competitors on brand marketing could hinder our ability to grow platform traffic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our marketing strategy includes performance marketing through search engines and social media, as well as paid and unpaid channels like search engine optimization (&#8220;SEO&#8221;). However, rising costs for keywords and changes in search engine algorithms can impact our visibility and increase customer acquisition costs. If we cannot effectively grow traffic without increasing performance marketing spend, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n",

      "SEO efforts are vulnerable to changes in search engine algorithms and consumer behavior, which can reduce our platform's prominence. If our listings are less visible, we may need to increase paid marketing, raising costs and affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If consumers become less reliant on search engines for travel searches and instead incorporate AI and machine learning and other channels, we may not be able to optimize for searches on these emerging channels and may risk losing traffic to competitors. Additionally, if major platforms like Google or Apple favor their own services or other partner services, our ability to engage users via mobile app or search could be impacted. \n",
      "\n",

      "Brand and Reputation Risks \n",
      "\n",
      "Host, guest, or third-party actions that are criminal, violent, inappropriate, dangerous, or fraudulent, may undermine the safety or the perception of safety on our platform and our ability to attract and retain hosts and guests and materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition . \n",

      "We cannot control or predict the actions of users and third parties, such as neighbors or invitees, during stays or experiences, including actions that may compromise the safety of hosts, guests, and others. Incidents involving alleged fatalities, injuries, sexual violence, fraud, privacy invasion, property damage, and discrimination have occurred and may occur in the future, potentially leading to legal liabilities and reputational damage. When a user is identity verified, it means that they provided information we validated through our process. In addition, we do not currently and may not in the future require users to re-verify their identity following their successful completion of the initial verification process. We conduct background checks for certain U.S. and Indian users and we screen users against sanctions watch lists, but these are not exhaustive due to regulatory, information, and frequency limitations. We do not verify all listings for safety or compliance, relying instead on user-reported issues, which may be incomplete or inaccurate. We have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to independently verify the safety, suitability, location, quality, compliance with Airbnb policies or standards, and legal compliance, such as fire code compliance or the presence of carbon monoxide detectors, hidden cameras or pool safety, of all our hosts&#8217; listings or experiences. We have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to independently verify the location, safety, or suitability of experiences for individual guests, the suitability, qualifications, or credentials of experiences hosts, or the qualifications of individual experiences guests. \n",

      "\n",
      "If hosts, guests, or third parties engage in criminal activity, misconduct, fraudulent, negligent, or inappropriate conduct, or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, we may receive negative media coverage, or be subject to involvement in a government investigation concerning such activity, which could adversely impact our brand and reputation, potentially leading consumers to think our platform and the listings on our platform are not safe, and lower the adoption rate of our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, certain regions where we operate have higher reported rates of violent crime or varying safety requirements, which can lead to more safety and security incidents, and may adversely impact the adoption of our platform in those regions and elsewhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, claims have been asserted against us from our hosts, guests, and third parties for compensation due to alleged fatalities, shootings, other violent acts, carbon monoxide incidents, hidden camera incidents, accidents, injuries, assaults, theft, property damage, data privacy and data security issues, fraudulent listings, and other incidents that are caused by other hosts, guests, or third parties while using our platform. These claims subject us to potentially significant liability and reputational damage, increase our operating costs and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have obtained some third-party insurance, which is subject to certain conditions and exclusions, for claims and losses incurred based on incidents related to bookings on our platform. Our insurance policies, which may or may not be applicable to all claims and may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all, may be inadequate to fully cover alleged claims of liability, investigation costs, defense costs, and/or payouts. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant time and cost investigating and defending against them. As we expand our offerings, or if the quantity or severity of incidents increases, our insurance rates and our financial exposure will grow, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "We track operational metrics such as Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, Average Daily Rate (&#8220;ADR&#8221;), active listings, active bookers, hosts, guest arrivals, greenhouse gas emissions, and other ESG metrics, which may differ from third-party estimates due to varying methodologies and assumptions. Our internal systems have limitations, and changes in tracking methods could lead to unexpected metric variations. Errors in these systems may result in inaccurate data reporting. Metrics like Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV are adjusted for cancellations and alterations that happen in the reporting period, but such cancellations and alterations can occur beyond the reporting period and can affect future metrics. Calculating these operational metrics requires ongoing data collection on new offerings that are added to our platform over time. Our business is complex, and the methodology used to calculate these metrics may require adjustments to accurately represent the full value of new offerings. \n",
      "\n",
      "An active booker is a unique guest who has booked a stay or experience in a given time period. Certain individuals may have more than one guest account and therefore may be counted more than once in our count of active bookers. We count the number of hosts on our platform based on the number of hosts with an available listing as of a certain date. Some individuals may have more than one host account and therefore may be counted more than once as hosts. \n",

      "Financial and Insurance Risks \n",
      "\n",
      "Our failure to properly manage funds held on behalf of customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We offer integrated payments in approximately 50 currencies to allow access to guest demand from more than 220 countries and regions and the ability for many hosts to be paid in their local currency or payment method of choice. When a guest books and pays for a stay or experience on our platform, we hold the total amount the guest has paid until check-in, at which time we recognize our service fee as revenue and initiate the process to remit the payment to the host, which generally occurs 24 hours after the scheduled check-in, barring any alterations or cancellations, which may result in funds being returned to the guest. Accordingly, at any given time, we hold on behalf of our hosts and guests a substantial amount of funds, which are generally held in bank deposit accounts and in U.S. government money market funds and recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to either safeguard customer funds in bankruptcy-remote bank accounts, or hold such funds in eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in such jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount held on behalf of customers. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the cash underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our platform and services, and result in significant penalties and fines from regulators, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The insurance coverage afforded by or available from our insurers may be inadequate for the needs of our business, and losses under our damage protection program could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to manage the exposures related to our business operations. We support our host community by maintaining a variety of host protection programs, such as AirCover for Hosts, which includes Host Liability Insurance, Experiences Liability Insurance, and our Host Damage Protection program. \n",
      "\n",
      "In relation to Airbnb&#8217;s insurance programs, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if (i) cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our expectations; (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits; (iii) our insurance providers become insolvent or otherwise fail to pay on our insurance claims; (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is denied by or disputed by our insurance providers; (v) claims costs exceed our captive insurance subsidiary&#8217;s forecast or reserves; or (vi) the number of claims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historic averages. Our spending for insurance has increased as our business has grown and losses from covered claims have increased. Premiums have increased as a result, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased difficulty in obtaining appropriate policy limits and levels of coverage at a reasonable cost and with reasonable terms and conditions. Our costs for obtaining these policies will continue to increase as our business grows and continues to evolve. Furthermore, as our business continues to develop and diversify, we may experience difficulty in obtaining insurance coverage for new and evolving offerings, which could require us to incur greater costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In relation to our Host Damage Protection program, which is a commercial guaranty agreement that provides reimbursement of up to $3 million for certain guest-caused loss or damages to a host property that are not reimbursed by the guest, we maintain a contractual liability insurance policy to provide coverage to us for losses incurred by us under the Host Damage Protection program. Increased frequency and severity and increased fraud could result in greater payouts, increased investigation costs, premium increases, and/or difficulty securing insurance coverage. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, if we fail to comply with insurance regulatory requirements in the regions where we operate, or other regulations governing insurance coverage, our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "We rely on third-party payment service providers to process payments made by guests and payments made to hosts on our platform. If these third-party payment service providers become unavailable or if we are subject to increased fees, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on a number of third-party payment service providers, including payment card networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways, to link us to payment card and bank clearing networks to process payments made by our guests and to remit payments to hosts on our platform. If these providers, some of whom are the sole providers of their particular service, become unable or unwilling to offer services on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be disrupted, requiring us to find alternatives providers and they may not be able to be replaced in a timely manner, or at all, or on favorable terms. Transitioning to new providers would demand significant resources and might not be well-received by users, potentially leading to losses and necessitating payments to hosts from our funds, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the software and services from these providers may fail to meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised, or experience outages, all of which could impact our ability to process payments, make timely payments to hosts, or comply with regulatory requirements, which could deter users and harm our reputation, possibly leading to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, or enforcement action. Agreements with providers may even allow them to hold our cash as a reserve under certain conditions, such as adverse business changes, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, and such fees result in significant costs. Payment card networks may impose special fees or assessments on any transaction that accesses their network. Our payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees, assessments or special fees on to us. Such interchange and other fees may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. \n",
      "\n",
      "Credit card transactions result in higher fees to us than transactions made through debit cards. Any material increase in interchange fees in the United States or other geographies, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations imposed by law in some geographies, or other network fees or assessments, or a shift from payment with debit cards to credit cards among our guests could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, inadequate investment in our payment infrastructure could hinder functionality and competitiveness, affecting usage. Further, expanding our payment services into additional geographies or offering new methods may introduce additional regulations and fraud risks, which would increase operating expenses. \n",
      "\n",
      "If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses or be unable to process payment transactions. \n",

      "We have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and other investments, including money market funds, certificates of deposit, U.S. government debt securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, government agency debt securities, mortgaged-backed and asset-backed securities, with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad for both our corporate balances and for funds held on behalf of our hosts and guests. We also rely on such banks and financial institutions to help process payments transactions. We have both significant funds flows from and to various financial institutions as a result of our processing of payments from guests to hosts. As part of our currency hedging activities on these balances, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and manage this exposure in an attempt to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition, or service interruptions at, or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets may be limited by the counterparty&#8217;s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, our ability to process payment transactions via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses and be required to make payments to hosts and/or refunds to guests out of our own funds, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

      "In March 2021, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the &#8220;2026 Notes&#8221;). In addition, on October 31, 2022, we entered into a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with $1.0 billion of initial commitments from a group of lenders (&#8220;2022 Credit Facility&#8221;). As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Facility, and we had total outstanding letters of credit of $19 million under the 2022 Credit Facility. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. \n",

      "\n",
      "Additionally, certain provisions of our 2026 Notes and related agreements could complicate or increase the cost for a third-party seeking to acquire us. Noteholders may require us to repurchase their notes for cash following a fundamental change, potentially straining our financial resources and leading to defaults under the indenture or other debt agreements. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the accounting treatment of the 2026 Notes as a liability and the use of the \"if-converted\" method for earnings per share calculations may negatively impact our reported financials. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the capped call transactions entered into in connection with the pricing of the 2026 Notes may affect the value of our Class A common stock. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, our existing credit agreement for our 2022 Credit Facility contains, and any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants, including a leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants, that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital, or make payments under our other indebtedness. The covenants in the agreement governing our 2022 Credit Facility, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries&#8217; abilities to (i) incur additional indebtedness at subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the 2022 Credit Facility; (ii) create or incur additional liens; (iii) partake in sale/leaseback transactions; (iv) engage in certain fundamental changes, including mergers or consolidations; and (v) enter into negative pledge clauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions. \n",
      "\n",

      "The failure to successfully execute and integrate acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have acquired multiple businesses and we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, which indebtedness could result in restrictions on our business and significant use of available cash to make payments of interest and principal. In addition, we may finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could result in further dilution to our existing stockholders. We may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "From time to time, we also make investments in private companies, which are inherently risky. To the extent our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we have recognized an expense to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value. Negative changes in the estimated fair value of private companies in which we invest could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

Adoption of a change in accounting principles or interpretations \n",

The loss of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate employees required for the planned expansion of our business, would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition and impair our ability to grow. To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program, and our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may be adversely affected by declines in our stock price. Additionally, if we issue significant equity to attract employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional stock-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. \n",

      "We have adopted a Live and Work Anywhere policy. The increase in remote working subjects us to certain operational challenges and could have adverse tax implications, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, we adopted our Live and Work Anywhere policy, which permits the majority of our employees to work remotely. Remote working subjects us to operational challenges and risks. For example, a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event may impact our employees&#8217; ability to work remotely. In addition, members of our workforce who work remotely may not have access to technology that is as robust as that in our offices, which could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to those remote workers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. We are also exposed to risks associated with the locations of remote workers, including compliance with local laws and regulations or exposure to compromised internet infrastructure. Allowing members of our workforce to work remotely creates intellectual property risk if employees create intellectual property on our behalf while residing in a jurisdiction with unenforced or uncertain intellectual property laws. Further, if employees fail to inform us of changes in their work location, we may unknowingly be exposed to additional risks. Remote working at our company (and at many third-party providers) also results in consumer, privacy, information technology and cybersecurity, and fraud risks due to the challenges associated with managing remote computing assets and security vulnerabilities that are present in many non-corporate and home networks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our transition to full or predominantly remote work environments also presents significant challenges to maintaining compliance with country and state requirements such as employee income tax withholding, the recording of reserves to cover withholding corrections or penalties, payroll tax remittance and reporting, payroll registration, and workers&#8217; compensation insurance. Additionally, foreign tax authorities may assert that certain of our entities have created permanent establishment in their countries , which could result in additional corporate income taxes and employee payroll withholding obligations. Any of these operational challenges or tax implications resulting from our Live and Work Anywhere policy may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Factors like unemployment, consumer debt, and financial market volatility can decrease consumer confidence and spending, particularly affecting leisure travel, which forms a substantial part of our business. Economic downturns have historically reduced travel spending, and future downturns could similarly decrease demand for our platform, leading to lower bookings, increased cancellations, and reduced revenue, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

For example, both we and hosts are increasingly subject to regulatory requirements related to climate-related considerations, and any additional regulations may require increased costs or attention for compliance. Our platform and services may also be adversely impacted to the extent travel behavior or other societal expectations shift in response to climate considerations, including if we do not successfully navigate stakeholder expectations regarding our own response to climate change. \n",

For example, the effect of significant downturns in bookings in a particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods due to this timing difference. Our expense levels are based on revenue estimates that may be inaccurate, and fixed expenses may lead to greater-than-expected losses if revenue falls short.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;) introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax and an excise tax on stock repurchases. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we accrued approximately $95 million of corporate alternative minimum tax, and approximately $20 million of excise tax on stock repurchases. Additionally, the U.S. government may implement further changes, such as increasing the corporate income tax rate or altering the taxation of international income. \n",

For example, in Italy, a law enacted in 2017 purports to require short-term rental platforms that process payments to withhold and remit host income tax and collect and remit tourist tax, amongst other obligations. In December 2023, without admitting any liability, Airbnb Ireland signed an agreement with the Italian Revenue Agency in settlement of the 2017-2021 audit periods for an aggregate payment of 576 million Euro ($621 million). Additionally, in December 2024, Airbnb Ireland signed a similar agreement in settlement of the 2022 audit period for an aggregate payment of 139 million Euro ($150 million). Such agreements settle a dispute about Airbnb Ireland&#8217;s obligations to withhold and remit host income tax, including taxes, interest, and penalties, for those relevant periods. Airbnb&#8217;s subsidiary in Italy and Airbnb Ireland continue to be, or could in the future be, subject to tax audits in Italy, including in relation to permanent establishment, transfer pricing, withholding obligations, and tourist taxes. Such audits could result in the imposition of additional potentially significant prior and future tax obligations. \n",

      "Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and determine the value of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including those of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation, and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Airbnb. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

      "We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. For example, our 2008 to 2024 tax years remain subject to examination in the United States and California due to tax attributes and statutes of limitations, and our 2020 to 2024 tax years remain subject to examination in Ireland. We are currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) for the years 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2018. We are continuing to respond to inquiries related to these examinations. In December 2020, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (&#8220;NOPA&#8221;) from the IRS for the 2013 tax year relating to the valuation of our international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. The notice proposed an increase to our U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of $1.3 billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $1.0 billion. We disagree with the proposed adjustment and intend to vigorously contest it. In January 2022, we entered into an administrative dispute process with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (&#8220;IRS Appeals&#8221;) regarding the proposed adjustment. An acceptable outcome was not reached with IRS Appeals, and in May 2024, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (&#8220;Notice&#8221;) from the IRS related to the aforementioned valuation of our international intellectual property. The Notice claims that we owe $1.3 billion in tax, plus penalties and interest. We will continue to pursue all available remedies to resolve this dispute. In July 2024, we petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (&#8220;Tax Court&#8221;) for redetermination, and if necessary, we will appeal the Tax Court&#8217;s decision to the \n",

If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position and such tax and related interest and penalties, if any, exceeds our current reserves, such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations, and any assessment of additional tax could require a significant cash payment and have a material adverse impact on our cash flow. \n",

      "We face complex and evolving tax obligations across various jurisdictions, which could significantly impact our business. We are subject to numerous taxes, including income and indirect taxes, and have received demands from governments for data to enforce tax laws against our hosts and guests. We collect and remit taxes on behalf of hosts when legally required, but disputes and lawsuits over tax responsibilities persist. New or revised tax laws could increase our tax liabilities and operational costs, potentially leading to penalties for non-compliance. \n",

These taxes could raise costs for hosts and guests, discourage platform use, and reduce revenue. For example, we recorded approximately $53 million in expense related to digital service taxes relating to prior periods as a result of refining our interpretation of the law as it applies to us. Additionally, we recorded $18 million of lodging tax expense in a particular jurisdiction over uncertainty as to how a new law applies to us. Compliance with tax reporting may require disclosing personal data, risking privacy concerns and regulatory actions. Competitors may adopt different tax strategies, potentially attracting our hosts and guests. \n",

Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that some of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future taxable income, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation&#8217;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change taxable income or income tax liabilities may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable income or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us. \n",

Such laws and regulations are complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and have limited and may continue to limit the ability or willingness of new or existing hosts to share their spaces through our platform. These regulations may expose our users or us to regulatory inquiries, litigation, and/or other disputes and to potentially significant liabilities, including taxes, compliance costs, fines, and criminal or other penalties, which have had and could continue to have a material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

These laws and regulations may impact the ability of hosts to list properties entirely and/or may limit the location and/or duration of stays permitted, or may establish other conditions upon which they are allowed to host. In addition, regulations may require that we, rather than local, state or national regulatory enforcement agencies, limit hosts&#8217; ability to list within those requirements. \n",

For example, we incur significant operational costs to comply with requirements of jurisdictions and cities that have disparate requirements around tax collection, tax reporting, data sharing, host registration, limits on lengths of stays, and other regulations, each of which may require us to dedicate significant resources to provide the infrastructure and tools needed on our platform for our hosts to meet these legal requirements and for us to fulfill any obligations we may have. Environmental, health, and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs, and our hosts&#8217; costs, to comply with such requirements may increase as a result. The complexity of our platform and changes required to comply with the large number of varying \n",
      "\n",
      "requirements can lead to constraints on supply as well as compliance gaps. Additionally, unclear and changing laws can deter hosts and guests from using our platform, reduce supply and demand, and increase litigation risks, adversely affecting our business. Failure or delays in complying with laws, even if unclear or in dispute, could subject us to penalties, including fines, business disruption and site blocking. \n",
      "\n",
      "We require hosts and guests to comply with all applicable legal obligations under our terms of service, but governments may nonetheless seek to hold us accountable for hosts&#8217; and guests&#8217; compliance. This can lead to penalties and costs that impact our reputation and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our compliance measures, such as requiring hosts to include registration numbers for listings in some jurisdictions, may increase platform friction and reduce listings and bookings. Host listings may also be limited by night caps, density restrictions, onerous permitting requirements, primary residence or host presence requirements, permit caps, minimum night stays, and/or discretionary permitting or lottery systems. Additional regulations could necessitate significant platform changes, discouraging use and increasing scrutiny and liability. \n",

Violation of these laws could subject the company to fines and penalties, including in some cases, criminal penalties. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regulatory Developments \n",
      "\n",
      "Hotels and groups affiliated with hotels have engaged and will likely continue to engage in various lobbying and political efforts for stricter regulations governing our business in both local and national jurisdictions. Additionally, private groups, such as homeowners and neighborhood associations, may adopt contracts or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict the ability of hosts to list their spaces. In some jurisdictions, regulations imposing restrictions on short-term rentals are increasingly fragmented at the local level, leading to increased compliance burden. These efforts, along with existing and potential new laws, could restrict short-term rentals, impose registration requirements and other limits to hosts&#8217; ability to list, and lead to significant fines and liabilities, materially affecting our platform's operations and financial condition. For instance, EU Member State laws pertaining to the recently enacted EU STR Regulation will require additional compliance efforts, potentially discouraging and prohibiting current and potential hosts from listing properties. As another example, the City of New York has effectively banned short-term rentals, and this has led to similar restrictions being considered throughout the State of New York. If other geographies emulate these regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We face ongoing disputes with government agencies over regulations, which may result in fines and operational changes. Some jurisdictions have imposed or may seek to impose taxes and licensing requirements on our platform and failure to comply could lead to penalties. We have resolved some disputes by agreeing to remove listings or share data with authorities. From time to time, we attempt to defend against application of laws and regulations that limit hosts&#8217; or guests&#8217; ability or willingness to list and search for accommodations, but have sometimes been and may continue to be unsuccessful in certain of those efforts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Increased regulatory interest in technology companies, particularly regarding AI, data privacy, competition, and sustainability, could lead to further compliance challenges. New or changing laws could impose significant costs and liabilities, affecting our business operations and financial condition.

      "We are frequently involved in legal and regulatory claims, including government inquiries and litigation related to short-term rentals, taxes, consumer protection, payment services, insurance, and data privacy. These proceedings are complex, costly, and time-consuming, requiring significant resources and potentially leading to fines, penalties, and operational changes. As our business grows, the number and complexity of these claims are expected to increase, potentially impacting our brand and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We face litigation, inquiries, investigations, audits, and proceedings with governments and other entities over regulations affecting short-term rentals and platform liability. Changes in legal interpretations could further impact our operations. Additionally, we are subject to claims related to incidents at listings, such as personal injuries, cancellations and refunds, and privacy violations, as well as class action lawsuits and government inquiries. If we become more involved in hosts&#8217; listings and conduct related to bookings, then we are more likely to draw scrutiny and additional regulations from governments and undercut various defenses we may have to claims or attempts to regulate us, which further constrain our business and impose additional liability on us as a platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as U.S. laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&#8220;DMCA&#8221;), the Stored Communications Act, and the Communications Decency Act (&#8220;CDA&#8221;), and non-U.S. laws such as the Digital Services Act (&#8220;DSA&#8221;), the EU STR Regulation, and the European E-Commerce Directive and their national transpositions are interpreted by the courts or if they are otherwise modified or amended, as our platform and services to our hosts and guests continue to expand, and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also face intellectual property disputes and indemnification obligations, which could lead to further litigation. In addition, compliance with escheatment laws and audits could result in additional liabilities and impact our financial results. \n",
      "\n",
      "Adverse outcomes in legal proceedings may result in significant financial penalties, changes to business practices, increased costs and reputational damage. Litigation diverts resources and may not be fully covered by our existing insurance policies, which may not be available to us on financially reasonable terms in the future or at all. Additionally, if we enter an agreement with a government or governmental agency to resolve a dispute, the terms of such agreement may be publicly available and could create a precedent that may lead to similar disputes in other jurisdictions and may put us in a weaker bargaining position in future disputes with other governments. As we expand, we anticipate continued legal challenges that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "We offer travel insurance products to guests, which subject us and our business to extensive laws, regulations, and supervision. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since June 2022, guests in certain jurisdictions have had the opportunity to purchase travel insurance when they make a booking. Over time, we expect to make travel insurance available to guests in additional countries. In the United States, travel insurance products are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which we transact business by state insurance departments. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of consumers. States have also adopted legislation defining and prohibiting unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts and practices in the business of insurance that may apply to insurance agencies. Noncompliance with any of such state statutes may subject us to regulatory action by the relevant state insurance regulator, and, in certain states, private litigation. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that any new laws, rules, or regulations, or unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules or regulations, may have on our business and financial results. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and independent agents. State insurance regulators may also conduct periodic examinations, the results of which could give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action. Similarly, travel insurance products are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the applicable regulators in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the European Union. The failure to comply with applicable state and foreign laws and regulations could result in fines, investigations and/or civil or criminal proceedings against us by governmental agencies and/or consumers which, if material, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, insurance carriers with which we place business are subject to regulations, which may affect how we conduct our operations.

As we expand further, we face varying and sometimes conflicting legal obligations. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in one jurisdiction may be prohibited by sanctions, AML, CTF, or other regulations in a different jurisdiction. We regularly assess our compliance programs and may identify gaps requiring costly enhancements to our policies and controls. \n",

      "Non-compliance or perceived failure to comply with these existing or new laws and regulations, including changes to or expansion of their interpretations, can lead to significant fines, lawsuits, regulatory and/or governmental investigations, enforcement actions, loss of required licenses and other civil and criminal penalties, forcing us to alter operations or delay product launches, adversely affecting our brand, business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects. The complexity of global regulations may trigger overlapping investigations by multiple authorities, impacting our relationships with financial institutions.

Compliance with EEA and UK regulations, such as the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act Regulation, the Luxembourg implementation of the EU Second Payment Services Directive (&#8220;PSD2&#8221;) and the UK's Payment Services Regulations 2017 (&#8220;UK PSR&#8221;), involves complex and \n",

      "potentially onerous requirements, including operational and payment security and strong customer authentication, which may increase compliance costs, raise risk of non-compliance, and impact the ease of usage of the payment features of the platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the proposed EU Third Payment Services Directive (&#8220;PSD3&#8221;) and proposed regulation on the same (&#8220;EU PSR&#8221;) will include amendments to strong customer authentication and anti-fraud obligations amongst other day-to-day requirements. The United Kingdom is also considering areas for reform for its payment services regime, including information requirements regarding currency conversion charges, and notice provisions for the termination of customer contracts. When these proposed measures are finalized and in-force, they may increase our compliance costs and require additional resources as well as changes to our processes and operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time, we apply for licenses in new jurisdictions, which subject us to additional compliance requirements and regulatory scrutiny. In unclear regulatory environments, we partner with local banks and processors, but may face restrictions from local regulators or need additional licenses or approvals. Obtaining and maintaining compliance with global licensing and regulatory requirements incurs significant costs and operational changes, with potential fines or other enforcement actions for violations. These challenges could delay or restrict our services, affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects. \n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer Protection \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to consumer protection laws in the United States and other countries where we operate. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which enforces federal consumer financial protection laws. We must comply with these laws, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E, which require service disclosures, error resolution, and consumer reimbursement for unauthorized transactions. The CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts, potentially increasing our compliance costs and litigation risks. Consumer protection laws could also be violated inadvertently, for example as a result of technical bugs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Violations of consumer protection laws could lead to fines, penalties, and changes in business practices, incurring substantial costs. State attorneys general and other officials can enforce federal consumer protection laws, and various agencies can conduct investigations that may result in significant penalties. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the United Kingdom and Luxembourg, payments-related consumer protection laws apply to APUK and APLux, and EU regulators may impose additional local requirements, including on our local banks and processors, potentially increasing costs or delaying business expansion in EU countries. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also issue gift cards in the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and many other jurisdictions, which are subject to consumer protection laws, and may face additional regulations if we expand these services. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, our payment services are subject to U.S. data privacy laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;), which governs the handling of personal information and imposes data security standards. Non-compliance could result in financial penalties. See our risk factor on data privacy and security compliance for more details. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to various AML and CTF laws and regulations around the world, including the BSA and the UK Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (as amended) (the &#8220;MLRs&#8221;). Among other things, the BSA and MLRs require money services businesses (including money transmitters like Airbnb Payments) to implement risk-based AML and CTF programs, report suspicious transactions or activities, and maintain transaction records. We must also comply with, among other requirements, the UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and Terrorism Act 2000, which prohibit the handling of criminal proceeds. We provide information to government agencies to assist in the detection and prevention of illegal activities and may be required to deny certain transactions, risking inadvertent denials of legal transfers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regulators may demand enhancements to our compliance programs, including customer identity verification and transaction monitoring. In the United Kingdom and European Union, stricter AML regulations could increase compliance costs and operational challenges and/or require us not to provide services to certain clients, potentially reducing business. Non-compliance with local laws implementing EU directives could result in fines up to 10% of APLux&#8217;s annual revenue, and similar penalties apply to APUK under the MLRs. \n",
      "\n",
      "The EU has agreed and adopted a comprehensive package of measures to reform the primary AML, CTF legislation across all EU 27 Member States (the package together is known as &#8220;MLD6&#8221;). This means that APLux will need to undertake a detailed impact assessment to the required uplifts to existing policies and procedures. This will likely result in material changes to the day to day AML and CTF operating procedures of APLux and material divergence between the AML and CTF rules applicable to APUK in the UK and those applicable to APLux, bringing with it increased costs and the regulatory enforcement risks (such as fines, censures and potentially the suspension or removal of regulatory licenses or controls placed on APLux&#8217;s ability to onboard new customers) associated with designing compliance with a nascent regime. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to governmental economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations that limit the scope of our offerings. Additionally, failure to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations could subject us to liability and negatively affect our business, results of operations , and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We must comply with economic and trade sanctions from governments where we operate, including U.S. agencies like the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;), the Council of the European Union, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation of His Majesty&#8217;s Treasury in the United Kingdom (&#8220;OFSI&#8221;), and Luxembourg's Ministry of Finance. These sanctions restrict transactions or dealings with certain countries, regions, and governments, and certain individuals or entities, such as those operating, \n",
      "\n",
      "organized, or resident in certain countries or regions or those listed on OFAC&#8217;s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Future sanctions in key business areas could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "To comply, we maintain and regularly update internal controls and report to OFAC, OFSI, and Luxembourg authorities on blocked or rejected payments and potential violations. Despite having these controls in place, there is a risk that we might inadvertently engage in transactions inconsistent with applicable sanctions laws. Any breaches or investigations could lead to claims or actions against us, affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As we grow and as regulations evolve, we may need to invest further in our internal controls or adjust our operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to payment network rules , and any material modification of our payment card acceptance privileges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The loss of our credit and debit card acceptance privileges or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain card acceptance privileges would significantly limit our business model since a vast majority of our guests pay using credit or debit cards. We must comply with payment card network rules, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (the &#8220;PCI DSS&#8221;), which requires robust internal controls over the use, storage, and transmission of card data to help prevent fraud. Compliance demands significant resources and ongoing attention, and any system failures could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Non-compliance with PCI DSS or payment network rules could breach our contracts with payment processors, leading to fines, penalties, and potential loss of card processing capabilities. Payment networks may also change rules, causing operational disruptions and compliance challenges. Even with compliance, we cannot guarantee the maintenance of our card acceptance privileges or the prevention of data or security breaches, illegal or improper use of our payments platform, or the theft, loss, or misuse of card data or the maintenance of card acceptance privileges. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are also subject to network operating rules and guidelines promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (&#8220;NACHA&#8221;) relating to payment transactions we process using the Automated Clearing House (&#8220;ACH&#8221;) Network, which may change and result in costly compliance measures. Failure to comply with these standards could result in losing our payment card acceptance privileges, materially affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Avoiding regulation under the Investment Company Act may adversely affect our operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which &#8220;investment companies&#8221; are permitted to conduct their business activities. We currently conduct, and intend to continue to conduct, our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We are not engaged primarily, nor do we hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. We do, however, make minority investments in companies and acquire other financial instruments from time to time that may be deemed investment securities. As such, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act without taking actions that may adversely affect our operations. For example, to avoid being deemed an investment company we may be required to sell certain of our assets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Evolving focus on environmental, social, and governance issues by shareholders, customers, regulators, politicians, employees, and other stakeholders may impose additional risks and costs on our business. \n",
      "\n",
      "ESG matters are an area of growing and evolving focus among our shareholders and other stakeholders, including customers, employees, regulators, politicians, and the general public in the United States and abroad. Companies like Airbnb face heightened expectations regarding matters such as environmental sustainability, diversity, human rights, and data privacy. We engage in various initiatives to serve our stakeholders in these and other areas, and to respond to stakeholder expectations regarding ESG, but such initiatives can be costly and may not have the desired effect. For example, many ESG initiatives (including related metrics and targets) are based on methodologies, standards, and data that are still evolving or are subject to variable interpretation; as with other companies, our approach to such matters evolves, and we cannot guarantee that our approach, either now or in future, will align with the expectations or preferences of any particular stakeholder or that certain disclosures will not be considered erroneous or subject to misinterpretation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, stakeholders have varying and sometimes conflicting perceptions of ESG matters. Both advocates and opponents of various issues are increasingly resorting to activism (including media campaigns and litigation) to advocate for their positions. Responding to such issues involves inherent costs, and any failure to successfully navigate stakeholder expectations could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. \n",
      "\n",
      "The regulatory landscape for ESG issues is also rapidly evolving, and various policymakers, including the European Union and State of California, among others, have adopted (or are considering adopting) requirements for climate- or other ESG-related disclosures or other actions. We may face risks related to sustainability reporting obligations under the evolving regulatory landscape in the European Union. Specifically, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (&#8220;CSRD&#8221;) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (&#8220;CSDDD&#8221;) impose stringent requirements on companies to disclose detailed information regarding their ESG practices. Furthermore, the transposition of the CSRD by EU member states will also impact the scope of these requirements. Many member states have not yet transposed the directive, adding another layer of uncertainty to compliance efforts. Additionally, the EU's Omnibus Simplification Package introduces further complexity and uncertainty in the European Union. Compliance involves significant expenses and resources, with risks of errors in implementing necessary changes. These requirements are not uniform, and may not be interpreted or applied uniformly, which may increase the cost and complexity of compliance, as well as any related risks. Various of our suppliers and other stakeholders are subject to similar risks, which may exacerbate, or create additional, risks on such matters. \n",

      "We have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims that we or others violated certain third-party intellectual property rights, which, even where meritless, can be costly to defend and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Internet and technology industries frequently face litigation over intellectual property rights, including allegations of infringement or misappropriation. We may encounter claims from third parties, including practicing and non-practicing entities, asserting that our platform, technologies, or branding infringe on or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. These claims can be costly and time-consuming to address, potentially diverting management's attention and resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "Intellectual property disputes could lead to significant liabilities, force us to cease using certain technologies or branding, or require us to obtain costly licenses or develop alternative solutions. These outcomes could increase our expenses and reduce our competitiveness, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "We receive from time to time, communications from third parties, including practicing and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed, misused, or otherwise misappropriated their intellectual property rights, including alleged patent infringement. Additionally, from time to time we have been involved in claims, suits, regulatory proceedings, and other proceedings involving alleged infringement, misuse, or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights, or relating to our intellectual property holdings and rights. While a number of the infringement claims raised against us have been based on our use or implementation of third-party technologies for which those third parties have been required to defend against the claims on our behalf and indemnify us from liability, intellectual property claims against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle, and could divert our management&#8217;s attention and other resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "As we expand our offerings or acquire new businesses, our exposure to intellectual property claims may increase.

      "Data privacy, data security, AI, marketing and consumer protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and rapidly evolving and we could be materially adversely affected by new legal requirements or changes to existing requirements including their interpretations and enforcement practices. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data processing practices, potentially increasing compliance costs or adversely affecting our business. We process personal data, such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, nationality, location information, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, and identity verification information (for example, government issued identification or passport), as well as credit card, bank account or other financial information, from and about hosts and guests, as well as our employees, job applicants, contractors and representatives of our third-party vendors, and other companies we do business with. We utilize third-party vendors, some of whom process data for us and provide various services, including but not limited to digital storage technology, business technology support, and other support functions. We and our vendors must comply with various state, federal, and foreign data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements, including those that generally require that we implement reasonable measures to keep such information secure and otherwise restrict the ways in which such information can be collected and used. These requirements, and their application, interpretation, and amendment are constantly evolving. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we note that as the use of AI and machine learning technologies (&#8220;AI and ML Technologies&#8221;) continues to grow, regulators (including data protection regulators) are expected to take an increased interest in issues, such as how we and our vendors collect, maintain and process and provide transparency on the use of personal data of our users and/ or hosts in that context. Our technology platform incorporates the use of AI and ML Technologies, for example, for fraud detection, search, enabling customized features and enhancing community support. Enhanced scrutiny of the use of AI and ML Technologies means that regulators may increasingly seek advance engagement with businesses like ours in respect of certain types of data processing. In addition, certain existing legal regimes, including those relating to data privacy and consumer protection, regulate certain aspects of AI and ML Technologies, and new laws regulating AI and ML Technologies have been or may be enacted or have entered into force in jurisdictions that we operate. This may affect our use of AI and ML Technologies and our ability to provide, improve or commercialize our services effectively and efficiently and result in increased costs. For example, in the United States, California enacted seventeen new laws in 2024 that further regulate the use of AI and ML Technologies and provide consumers with additional protections around companies&#8217; use of AI and ML Technologies, such as requiring companies to disclose certain uses of generative AI. Other states have also passed AI-focused legislation, such as Colorado&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Act, which will require developers and deployers of &#8220;high-risk&#8221; AI systems to implement certain safeguards against algorithmic discrimination, and Utah&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, which establishes disclosure requirements and accountability measures for the use of generative AI in certain consumer interactions. Other legislation has been introduced or proposed at the federal and state level, and there remains uncertainty at the federal level regarding the regulation of AI and ML Technologies. Further, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (the &#8220;EU AI Act&#8221;) entered into force in August 2024, and establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market. The majority of the substantive requirements will apply from August 2026. The EU AI Act applies to companies that develop, use and/or provide AI in the EU and &#8211; depending on the AI use case &#8211; includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose AI and foundation models, and fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover. These regulations may impact our ability to use, procure and commercialize AI and ML Technologies in the future, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our products or services, including if the laws are not consistent across jurisdictions. \n",

The GDPR comprehensively regulates our use of personal data, including cross-border transfers of personal data out of Europe. Many large geographies in which we operate, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, and South Korea have passed or are in the process of passing comparable or other robust data privacy and security legislation or regulation, which may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. \n",
      "\n",
      "In relation to cross-border transfers of personal data outside of Europe, we expect the existing legal complexity and uncertainty regarding international personal data transfers to continue. In particular, the European Commission approval of the current EU-US Data Privacy Framework for data transfers to certified entities in the United States may be challenged, which could also lead to challenges to, or impact the effectiveness of, other data transfer mechanisms such as the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism). In general, we expect that international transfers to the United States and to other jurisdictions more generally to continue to be subject to enhanced scrutiny by regulators and we cannot guarantee the ongoing efficacy of our data transfer mechanisms. It is also possible that transfers of personal data outside the United States could be restricted or impacted by developments at the federal level. As the regulatory guidance and enforcement landscape in relation to data transfers continue to develop, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, and/or regulatory investigations or fines, we may have to stop using certain tools and vendors and make other operational changes, including updating agreements or implementing additional safeguards which could otherwise affect the manner in which we provide our services, our ability to provide our services and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "In the United States, there are numerous federal and state data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, maintenance, disclosure and processing of personal data, including federal and state data privacy laws, data breach notification laws, electronic communications laws, and marketing and consumer protection laws. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and state regulators enforce a variety of data privacy issues, such as misrepresentations in privacy policies or failures to appropriately protect information about individuals, as unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of the FTC Act or similar state laws. Additionally, the GLBA and its implementing regulations, restrict and impose certain requirements on the processing of personal data, including notice to individuals of privacy practices and requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal data. Moreover, as we send marketing messages via email and short message service, or SMS, text messages, we are subject to the CAN-SPAM Act, which imposes certain obligations regarding the content of emails and providing and honoring opt-outs, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which imposes restrictions on the ability to send text messages without prior consent. \n",

In addition, numerous states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the processing of state residents&#8217; personal data that have and may continue to require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur related costs and expenses. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;) provides enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording residents the right to access and delete their data and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal data. The CCPA imposes a range of other compliance obligations and imposes severe statutory damages, which could lead to injunctive relief or agreed settlements providing for ongoing audit and reporting requirements, as well as a private right of action, for certain data breaches. This private right of action has increased the risks associated with data breach litigation. The enactment of the CCPA prompted a wave of similar legislative developments in other states, which creates a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. For example, since the CCPA went into effect, comprehensive privacy statutes that share similarities with the CCPA are now in effect and enforceable in other states. Many other states have passed or proposed similar laws and there remains increased interest at the federal level as well. \n",

      "Further, the majority of the substantive provisions of the DSA took effect in February 2024. The DSA governs, among other things, our potential liability for illegal services/products or content on our platform, obligations around traceability of business users, and requires enhanced transparency measures. In particular our obligations to diligence the services offered on our platform could require significant additional resources. Further, the DSA contains general requirements that user interfaces may not deceive or manipulate users which are yet to be clarified further by guidance. The DSA may increase our compliance costs, require changes to our user interfaces, processes, operations, and business practices which may adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and provide our services to customers, and may otherwise adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with the DSA can result in fines of up to 6% of total annual worldwide turnover and recipients of services have the right to seek compensation from providers in respect of damage or loss suffered due to infringement by the provider to comply with the DSA. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the Online Safety Act 2023, or the OSA, establishes an extensive regulatory framework for certain user-to-user and search services and imposes obligations to protect users from illegal content which, if applicable, may increase compliance costs and may otherwise adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with the OSA can result in fines of up to 10% of total annual worldwide turnover or &#163;18 million (whichever is greater). \n",

      "Various other governments and consumer agencies around the world have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically. Together, these existing and proposed laws add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources to compliance programs and cybersecurity, which could impact strategies, and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. Compliance with numerous and often contradictory requirements of different jurisdictions is particularly difficult for an online business such as ours, which collects personal information from hosts, guests, and other individuals in multiple jurisdictions. If any jurisdiction in which we operate adopts new laws or changes its interpretation of its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or localization such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we could risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. As in many cases these laws are relatively new and the interpretation and application of these laws is uncertain. There may be litigation, claims and enforcement relating to data privacy, and the processing of personal data may involve new interpretations of privacy laws. For example, there has been a noticeable increase in class actions in the United States where plaintiffs have utilized a variety of laws, including state wiretapping laws, in relation to the use of tracking technologies, such as cookies and pixels. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, to help improve the trust and safety on our platform, we conduct certain verification procedures aimed at our hosts, guests, and listings in certain jurisdictions. Such verification procedures may include utilizing public information on the Internet, accessing public databases such as court records, utilizing third-party vendors to analyze host or guest data, or physical inspection. These types of activities expose us to requirements of other laws and regulations, and to the risk of regulatory engagement and/or enforcement from privacy regulators, consumer protection agencies, consumer credit reporting agencies, and civil litigation. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we are required to disclose personal data to government agencies, such as tax authorities and law enforcement agencies, this could be perceived by third parties as non-compliance with data privacy and security laws, potentially leading to legal proceedings or actions \n",
      "\n",
      "against us. Conversely, if we refuse to provide requested information due to a disagreement, such as on the interpretation of the law, we may face actions, litigation, and increased regulatory scrutiny, which could harm our relationships with governments and limit our ability to operate in certain regions. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Any failure or perceived failure by us and/or our vendors or third-party providers to comply with data privacy and data security laws, rules, or regulations could expose us to material penalties, significant legal liability, changes in how we operate or offer our products, and interruptions or cessation of our ability to operate in key geographies, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, as we are subject to both the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, we could be fined under each regime independently in respect of the same breach. Penalties for certain breaches are up to the greater of &#8364;20 million or &#163;17.5 million, or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. \n",

      "In addition, any failure or perceived failure to comply with consumer protection, marketing, data privacy or data security laws, rules, and regulations; policies; industry standards; or enforcement notices and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit) could lead to legal actions by individuals, consumer rights groups, government agencies, or others. We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation, injunctive relief, or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, and diversion of internal resources or other regulatory orders adversely impacting the ways our business can use personal data. These proceedings could be costly to litigate, whether or not they have merit, and result in negative publicity and erode trust, potentially requiring us to make costly changes to our business practices. If these events occur, they could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition, and overall results. \n",

      "Since our founding, we have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our platform. We rely on computer systems, hardware, software, technology infrastructure, and online sites and networks for both internal and external operations that are critical to our business (collectively, &#8220;IT Systems&#8221;). We own and manage some of these IT Systems but also rely on third-party IT Systems for certain operations, including payment processing and accounting. Significant consumer growth or third-party failures may require costly upgrades, potentially affecting our business, and if our systems and network infrastructure cannot be expanded or are not scaled to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience significant operational interruptions, including poor performance, incorrect payments, search ranking issues, unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, and delays in the introduction of new offerings, decreased customer satisfaction, and loss of users. Our reliance on the Internet and mobile networks could also lead to disruptions in access. Our IT Systems, including those from third-party providers, are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters. For example, our San Francisco operations are at risk from earthquakes and power outages, which could disrupt business operations. Such disruptions could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have experienced IT System failures from time to time. While we invest in system reliability, these measures may not fully prevent downtime, and our existing business interruption insurance may not cover all losses or be available to us on economically reasonable terms in the future or at all. For further information, see the risk factor titled &#8220;If we or our third-party providers fail to protect confidential information and/or experience security incidents, there may be damage to our brand and reputation, material financial penalties, and legal liability, along with a decline in use of our platform, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.&#8221; \n",

There are significant risks involved in adopting, developing, maintaining, and deploying these technologies, and there can be no assurance that the usage of such technologies will enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability. In particular, AI and ML Technologies may be incorrectly designed or implemented; may be trained or reliant on incomplete, inadequate, inaccurate, biased, or otherwise poor quality data or on data to which we or third parties do not have sufficient rights; and/or may be adversely impacted by unforeseen defects, technical challenges, cybersecurity threats, third-party litigation or regulatory action, or material performance issues. Any of the above could negatively impact the performance of our products, services and business, as well as our reputation, and we could incur liability and costs resulting from the actual or perceived violation of laws or contracts to which we are a party or civil claims. \n",

      "In addition, AI and ML Technologies, including generative AI, may be vulnerable to adversarial user behavior or create inaccurate or misleading content or other discriminatory or unexpected results or behaviors, such as hallucinatory behavior that can generate irrelevant, unintended, nonsensical, or factually incorrect results. Our hosts, guests or others may rely on or use this flawed content or information to their detriment, which may expose us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, consumer complaints, legal liability, and other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The use of AI and ML Technologies presents emerging ethical and social issues, and if we enable or offer solutions that draw scrutiny or controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on our customers or on society as a whole, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, consumer complaints, legal liability, and other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "In addition to our proprietary technologies, we use AI and ML Technologies licensed from third parties. Our ability to continue to adopt, integrate and use such technologies at the scale we may need may be dependent on access to specific third-party software and infrastructure, such as processing hardware or third-party AI models, and we cannot control the quality, availability or pricing of such third-party software and infrastructure, especially in a highly competitive environment. If any such third-party AI and ML Technologies become incompatible with our offerings or unavailable for use or have degradations in performance, or if the providers of such models unfavorably change the terms on which their AI and ML Technologies are offered or terminate their relationship with us, our solutions may become less appealing to our customers. In addition, to the extent any third-party AI and ML Technologies are used as a vendor hosted service, any disruption, outage, or loss of information through such hosted services could disrupt our operations or solutions, damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our solutions, or result in legal claims or proceedings, for which we may be unable to recover damages from the affected provider. \n",

      "The regulatory and intellectual property frameworks governing the use and protection of AI and ML Technologies and of its outputs are rapidly evolving, and we cannot predict how future legislation and regulation will impact our ability to offer and protect products or services that we develop which leverage AI and ML Technologies. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or proposed additional laws and regulations. Additionally, existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect the operation of and availability of IP protection for our AI and ML Technologies. As a result, implementation standards, enforcement practices, and available scope of protection are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, or standards may have on our business (including our positioning with respect to our competition) and may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these laws or regulations. Already, certain existing legal regimes (e.g., relating to data privacy) regulate certain aspects of AI and ML Technologies, and new laws regulating AI and ML Technologies are expected to continue to be proposed and enacted in the United States and globally. For further information related to AI laws and regulations that may affect our business, see the risk factor titled &#8220;Compliance with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to data privacy, data security, artificial intelligence, marketing and consumer protection involves significant expenditure and resources, and any actual or perceived failure by us or our vendors to comply may result in significant liability, litigation or other legal action against us, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and/or result in regulatory scrutiny, fines and penalties and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.&#8221; \n",

      "It is also possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and in other non-U.S. jurisdictions, or that existing laws and regulations, including data privacy, consumer protection, competition laws, may be interpreted in ways that would limit our ability to use AI and ML Technologies for our business, or require us to change the way we use AI and ML Technologies in a manner that negatively affects the performance of our products, services, and business and requires us to expend resources and adjust our products or services in certain jurisdictions. Further, the cost to comply with such laws, regulations, or decisions and/or guidance interpreting existing laws, could be significant and would increase our operating expenses (such as by imposing additional reporting obligations regarding our use of AI and ML Technologies).

Our platform relies upon content that is created and posted by hosts, guests, or other third parties. Although content on our platform is typically generated by third parties, and not by us, claims of defamation, disparagement, negligence, warranty, personal harm, intellectual property infringement, or other alleged damages could be asserted against us, in addition to our hosts and guests. While we rely on legal exemptions and protections like the DMCA and CDA in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in the European Union, varying laws and interpretations regarding immunity and responsibility across jurisdictions may limit these exemptions or defenses or create uncertainty regarding liability for information or content uploaded by hosts, guests, or other third parties. To the extent that Airbnb creates or is deemed to create or facilitate such content on the platform, these defenses may be less available. New regulations could increase our liability and compliance costs, impacting our business. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, changes to the CDA could reduce protections for online platforms. In the EU, the DSA and Digital Markets Act (&#8220;DMA&#8221;) introduced new compliance requirements and potential fines. Other regions, like Asia and Latin America, have or are developing regulations that could impose direct or secondary liability on platforms for harmful content.

While these initiatives are crucial for community trust, they can increase platform friction, potentially reducing host and guest activity and materially adversely affecting our business. These trust and safety efforts, including limited verification of hosts and listings and restrictions on certain types of bookings, our neighborhood hotline, or other initiatives, incur significant costs and may lead to fewer listings and bookings. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a global platform, the implementation of these measures varies by region and may be limited by local laws. Despite our investments, we cannot guarantee these measures will be successful, significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on or off our platform, or be sufficient to protect our reputation in the event of such activity. Additionally, our community standards, including commitments to inclusion and belonging that are required when a user joins Airbnb, may not always be clearly communicated or well understood by all parts of our community, leading to unmet expectations among hosts and guests, which may lead to fewer listings and bookings. \n",

When hosts do not fulfill their obligations to guests, there are fictitious listings or fraudulent bookings on our platform, or there are host account takeovers, we have incurred and will continue to incur losses from claims by hosts and guests, and these losses may be substantial. Such instances have and can lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings, referred to as a &#8220;chargeback.&#8221; For the year ended December 31, 2024, total chargeback expense was $96 million. The capabilities of criminal fraudsters and the susceptibility of individuals to fraud pose ongoing risks. Despite measures to detect and reduce fraud, these efforts require continuous improvement to address evolving threats, especially with new payment methods and technology platforms. \n",

In addition, the use of third-party open-source software could expose us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software to the extent open-source licensors do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software equivalent to those provided by third-party commercial software providers. We also license to others some of our software through open-source projects. Open sourcing our own software requires us to make the source code publicly available, and therefore can limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to that software. From time to time, companies that use open-source software have faced claims challenging the use of open-source software or compliance with open-source license terms. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or claiming noncompliance with open-source licensing terms. \n",

      "Inadvertent use of open-source software can occur in software development in the Internet and technology industries. Such inadvertent use of open source software could expose us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of the underlying licenses, which could lead to unforeseen business disruptions, including being restricted from offering parts of our platform which incorporate the software, being required to publicly release proprietary source code, being required to re-engineer parts of our code base to comply with license terms, or being required to extract the open source software at issue. Our exposure to these risks may be increased as a result of evolving our core source code base, introducing new offerings, integrating acquired-company technologies, or making other business changes, including in areas where we do not currently compete.

Stock prices of many companies, including travel companies and technology companies, have fluctuated in a manner often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of stock volatility.

The multi-series structure of our common stock could make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices may not invest in our Class A common stock. It is unclear what effect, if any, such policies and restrictions could have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included, and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors.

Share repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, or accelerated share repurchase transactions or by any combination of such methods. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. The manner, timing and amount of any share repurchases may fluctuate and will be determined by us based on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, our priorities for the use of cash to support our business operations and plans, general business and market conditions, tax laws, and alternative investment opportunities, all of which may be further impacted by macroeconomic conditions and factors, including rising interest rates, and inflation, tariffs, global conflicts, and public health crises. Our share repurchase program authorizations do not have an expiration date nor do they obligate us to acquire any specific number or dollar value of shares. Our share repurchase programs may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our Class A common stock. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a 1% excise tax on share repurchases, which increases the costs associated with \n",

      "Under our restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of Class C common stock. Any future issuance of Class C common stock may have the effect of further concentrating voting control in the holders of our Class B common stock, including the Class B common stock held by our founders, and may discourage potential acquisitions of our business, and could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. \n",

      "Under our restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of Class C common stock. We may in the future issue shares of Class C common stock for a variety of corporate purposes, including financings, acquisitions, investments, and equity incentives to our employees, consultants, and directors. Our authorized but unissued shares of Class C common stock are available for issuance with the approval of our board of directors without stockholder approval, except as may be required by the Listing Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;). Because the Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), is not convertible into any other capital stock, and is not listed for trading on an exchange or registered for sale with the SEC, shares of Class C common stock may be less liquid and less attractive to any future recipients of these shares than shares of Class A common stock, although we may seek to list the Class C common stock for trading and register shares of Class C common stock for sale in the future. In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, the holders of our Class B common stock, including our founders who are parties to a Nominating Agreement and a Voting Agreement, may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us that stockholders may otherwise support, and could allow us to take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, such issuances would have a dilutive effect on the economic interests of our Class A and Class B common stock. Any such issuance of Class C common stock could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline. \n",

We may engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, our stockholders will experience additional dilution when option holders exercise their right to purchase common stock under our equity incentive plans, when RSUs vest and settle, when we issue equity awards to our employees under our equity incentive plans, or when we otherwise issue additional equity. Additionally, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. \n",

      "Our Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, our Class C common stock has no votes per share, and our Class H common stock has no votes per share. Because of the 20-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively continue to control a significant percentage of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until all such outstanding shares of Class B common stock have converted into shares of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, our founders, who collectively hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, are party to a Voting Agreement under which each founder and his affiliates and certain other entities agree to vote their shares for the election of each individual founder to our board of directors. We and each of our founders are party to a Nominating Agreement under which we and the founders are required to take certain actions to include the founders in the slate of nominees nominated by our board of directors for the applicable class of directors, include them in our proxy statement, and solicit proxies or consents in favor of electing each founder to our board of directors. This concentrated control limits or precludes other stockholders&#8217; ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major \n",

      "Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes or transfers among our founders, if all of our founders agree to such transfers. Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Class B holder into one share of Class A common stock. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result, it is possible that one or more of the persons or entities holding our Class B common stock could gain significant voting control as other holders of Class B common stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into Class A common stock. In addition, the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock dilutes holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. In addition, any future issuances of common stock would be dilutive to holders of Class A common stock. For example, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. Further, each outstanding share of Class H common stock will convert into a share of Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis upon the sale of such share of Class H common stock to any person or entity that is not our subsidiary, which would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. \n",

      " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our Class A common stock. The following material factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors, and oral statements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Risks Related to Our Business \n",
      "\n",
      "Our revenue growth rate has slowed over time, and we expect it to continue to slow in the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have experienced significant revenue growth in the past; however, our revenue growth rate has slowed over time and there is no assurance that historic growth rates will return. Our future revenue growth depends on the growth of supply and demand for listings on our platform, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide as well as trends in the global travel and hospitality industries and the short and long-term accommodation regulatory landscape. In addition, we believe that our revenue growth depends upon a number of factors, including: \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates and recessionary concerns; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; our ability to retain and grow the number of guests and Nights and Experiences Booked; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; our ability to retain and grow the number of Hosts and the number of available listings on our platform; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; events beyond our control such as pandemics and other health concerns, restrictions on travel and immigration, political, social or economic instability, including international disputes, war, or terrorism, trade disputes, economic downturns, and the impact of climate change on travel including the availability of preferred destinations and the increase in the frequency and severity of weather-related events, including fires, floods, droughts, extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, severe weather, and other natural disasters, and the impact of other climate change on seasonal destinations; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; competition; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; the legal and regulatory landscape and changes in the application of existing laws and regulations or adoption of new laws and regulations that impact our business, Hosts, and/or guests, including changes in short-term occupancy, tax laws, and real estate broker laws; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; the attractiveness of home sharing to prospective Hosts and guests; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; the level of consumer awareness and perception of our brand; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; our ability to build and strengthen trust and safety on our platform and among members of our community; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; the level of spending on brand and performance marketing to attract Hosts and guests to our platform; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; our ability to grow new offerings and to deepen our presence in certain geographies; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades to our platform and infrastructure; and \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n",
      "\n",
      "A softening of demand, whether caused by events outside of our control, challenging macroeconomic and political conditions, changes in Host and guest preferences, public health crises such as pandemics, and any of the other factors described above, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or otherwise, may result in decreased revenue and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we fail to retain existing Hosts or add new Hosts, or if Hosts fail to provide high-quality stays and experiences, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business depends on Hosts maintaining their listings on our platform and engaging in practices that encourage guests to book those listings, including increasing the number of nights and experiences that are available to book, providing timely responses to inquiries from guests, offering a variety of desirable and differentiated listings at competitive prices that meet the expectations of guests, and offering exceptional hospitality, services, and experiences to guests. These practices are outside of our direct control. If Hosts do not establish or maintain a sufficient number of listings and availability for listings, the number of Nights and Experiences Booked declines for a particular period, or the price charged by Hosts declines, our revenue would decline and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hosts manage and control their spaces and experiences and typically market them on our platform with no obligation to make them available to guests for specified dates and with no obligation to accept bookings from prospective guests. We have had many Hosts list their properties on our platform in one period and cease to offer these properties in subsequent periods for a variety of reasons. While we plan to continue to invest in our Host community and in tools to assist Hosts, these investments may not be successful in growing our Hosts and listings on our platform. In addition, Hosts may not establish or maintain listings if we cannot attract prospective guests to our platform and generate bookings from a large number of guests. If we are unable to retain existing Hosts or add new Hosts, or if Hosts elect to market their listings exclusively with a competitor or cross-list with a competitor, we may be unable to offer a sufficient supply and variety of properties or experiences to attract guests to use our platform. In particular, it is critical that we continue to attract and retain individual Hosts who list their spaces, including private rooms, primary homes, or vacation homes, on Airbnb. We attract individual Hosts predominantly through organic channels such as word of mouth and our strong brand recognition. If we are unable to attract and retain individual Hosts in a cost-effective manner, or at all, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

If we are not able to effectively deploy professional tools, application programming interfaces, and payment processes, work with third-party channel managers, and develop effective sales and account management teams that address the needs of these professional Hosts, we may not be able to attract and retain professional Hosts. If our fee structure and payment terms are not as competitive as those of our competitors, these professional Hosts may choose to provide less inventory and availability with us. Historically, we have seen an increase in the number of, and revenue from, professional Hosts on our platform. The uniqueness of listings on our platform will be negatively impacted if the number of individual Hosts does not grow at the same rate. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the number of listings on Airbnb may decline as a result of a number of other factors affecting Hosts, including: any pandemic; enforcement or threatened enforcement of laws and regulations, including short-term occupancy and tax laws; private groups, such as homeowners, landlords, and condominium and neighborhood associations, adopting and enforcing contracts that prohibit or restrict home sharing; leases, mortgages, and other agreements, or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict home sharing; Hosts opting for long-term rentals on other third-party platforms as an alternative to listing on our platform; economic, social, and political factors; perceptions of trust and safety on and off our platform; negative experiences with guests, including guests who damage Host property, throw unauthorized parties, or engage in violent and unlawful acts; and our decision to remove Hosts from our platform for not adhering to our Host standards or other factors we deem detrimental to our community. \n",

If we discontinue these programs or these programs prove less effective, whether because our payouts under these programs or our insurance premiums become cost prohibitive or for any other reason, then the number of Hosts who list with us may decline. \n",

Events beyond our control, such as unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, tsunamis, floods, severe weather, droughts, extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, and volcanic eruptions, the frequency and severity of which may be increasingly impacted by climate change in future years (although it is currently impossible to predict with accuracy the scale of such impact), and travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Ebola, Zika, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and COVID-19, trade or immigration policies, wars, such as the ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine or in the Middle East, terrorist attacks, sources of political uncertainty, political unrest, protests, violence in connection with political or social events, foreign policy changes, regional hostilities, flight capacity restrictions, immigration restrictions (including backlogs on passport renewals or limitations on visa grants), imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, changes in regulations, policies, or conditions related to physical climate change-related impacts, including chronic and acute climate-related impacts and climate-related migration, sustainability-related conditions, work stoppages, labor unrest, or travel-related accidents can disrupt travel globally or otherwise result in declines in travel demand. Because many of these events or concerns, and the full impact of their effects, are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our platform and services, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, increasing awareness of the impact of air travel on climate change and the impact of over-tourism may adversely impact the travel and hospitality industries and demand for our platform and services, whether due to the imposition of policies and regulations or changing societal attitudes towards travel. \n",

      "Additionally, the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including adverse economic conditions, are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Our financial performance is subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, worldwide or regional recession, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, fluctuations in exchange rates, inflation, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, tariffs, and other macroeconomic factors. Additional adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, high unemployment, and currency fluctuations can adversely affect consumer confidence in spending and materially adversely affect the demand for travel or similar experiences. Additionally, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy shortages or cost increases, labor and healthcare costs, and other economic factors. These factors may affect demand for our offerings, and uncertainty about global or regional economic conditions can also have a negative adverse impact on the number of Hosts and guests who use our platform. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected, which could lead to a decline in the bookings and prices for stays and experiences on our platform and an increase in cancellations, and thus result in lower revenue. Leisure travel in particular, which accounts for a substantial majority of our current business, is dependent on discretionary consumer spending levels. Downturns in worldwide or regional economic conditions have led to a general decrease in leisure travel and travel spending in the past, and similar downturns in the future may materially adversely impact demand for our platform and services. Such a shift in consumer behavior would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

The global travel industry has experienced significant consolidation, and we expect this trend may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in a highly competitive industry. Consolidation amongst our competitors will give them increased scale and may enhance their capacity, abilities, and resources, and lower their cost structures.

Some of these competitors also aggregate property listings obtained through various sources, including the websites of property managers. Some of our Hosts have chosen to cross-list their properties, which reduces the availability of such properties on our platform. When properties are cross-listed, the price paid by guests on our platform may be or may appear to be less competitive for a number of reasons, including differences in fee structure and policies, which may cause guests to book through other services, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

      "Some of our competitors or potential competitors have more established or varied relationships with consumers than we do, and they could use these advantages in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by entering the travel and accommodations businesses.

If any of these platforms are successful in offering services similar to ours to consumers, or if we are unable to offer our services to consumers within these super-apps, our customer acquisition efforts could be less effective and our customer acquisition costs, including our brand and performance marketing expenses, could increase, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We also face increasing competition from search engines including Google. How Google presents travel search results, and its promotion of its own travel meta-search services, such as Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, or similar actions from other search engines, and their practices concerning search rankings, could decrease our search traffic, increase traffic acquisition costs, and/or disintermediate our platform. These parties can also offer their own comprehensive travel planning and booking tools, or refer leads directly to suppliers, other favored partners, or themselves, which could also disintermediate our platform. In addition, if Google or Apple use their own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor their own or other preferred travel service offerings, or impose policies that effectively disallow us to continue our full product offerings in those channels, it could materially adversely affect our ability to engage with Hosts and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search. \n",

Uncertain and unclear application of such laws and regulations to Host and guest activity and our platform could cause and has caused some Hosts and guests to leave or choose not to use our platform, reduce supply and demand for our platform and services, increase the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, and increase the threat of litigation or enforcement actions related to our platform, all of which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

The European Commission in parallel proposed a Financial Data Access Regulation (&#8220;FIDA&#8221;). PSD3 and the PSR will include amendments to strong customer authentication and anti-fraud obligations amongst other day to day requirements, and FIDA requires data holders (including payment institutions and EMIs) to provide customer data, including both personal and non-personal data to other data holders. PSD3, the PSR and FIDA are still in draft, however when finalized and in-force, they may increase our compliance costs and require additional resources as well as changes to our processes and operations. In addition, in January 2023, the UK HM Treasury published a review of the UK Payment Services Regulations 2017 (&#8220;UK PSR&#8221;) and call for evidence. The review and call for evidence contained minimal information on areas of reform, other than a handful of areas including strong customer authentication requirements, information requirements regarding currency conversion charges, and notice provisions for the termination of customer contracts.

We may be subject to additional laws and regulations which could require significant changes to our platform that discourage Hosts and guests from using our platform. Furthermore, if we become more involved in Hosts&#8217; listings and conduct related to bookings, then we are more likely to draw scrutiny and additional regulations from governments and undercut various defenses we may have to claims or attempts to regulate us, which further constrain our business and impose additional liability on us as a platform. \n",

      "Regulatory Developments \n",
      "\n",
      "Hotels and groups affiliated with hotels have engaged and will likely continue to engage in various lobbying and political efforts for stricter regulations governing our business in both local and national jurisdictions. Other private groups, such as homeowners, landlords, and condominium and neighborhood associations, have adopted contracts or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict short-term rentals, and third-party lease agreements between landlords and tenants, home insurance policies, and mortgages may prevent or restrict the ability of Hosts to list their spaces. These groups and others cite concerns around affordable housing and over-tourism in major cities among other issues, and some state and local governments have implemented or considered implementing rules, ordinances, or regulations governing the short-term or long-term rental of properties and/or home sharing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Legislation could have a material impact on the way short-term and long-term rentals are regulated. Such regulations include ordinances that restrict or ban Hosts from short-term rentals or long-term rentals, set annual caps on the number of days Hosts can share their homes, require Hosts to register with the municipality or city, or require Hosts to obtain permission before offering short-term rentals, or impose obligations on us to assist in the enforcement of these regulations. For example, in New York City a law enacted in 2022 limits the properties that can host short-term rentals. It also contains several new obligations for short-term rental hosts and platforms. Existing, and changes to, laws and regulations such as these may limit Hosts&#8217; ability and willingness to list on our platform and may result in significant fines, liabilities, and penalties to the Company. In addition, some jurisdictions regard short-term rental or home sharing as &#8220;hotel use&#8221; and claim that such use constitutes a conversion of a residential property to a commercial property. Macroeconomic pressures and public policy concerns could continue to lead to new laws and regulations, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or widespread enforcement actions that limit the ability of Hosts to share their spaces or impose obligations upon us. For example, the European Union&#8217;s regulation on short-term rentals (the &#8220;EU STR Regulation&#8221;) is expected to enter into force in April 2024 and EU member states will have two years to give effect to the new rules under the regulation. The EU STR Regulation includes steps to enhance the transparency of certain host information on platforms (such as host registration numbers where required locally) and monthly reporting by platforms to local authorities (including, for example, host information, length of stay, and number of guests). The EU STR Regulation could have a material impact on the way short-term rentals are regulated in the European Union and will require us to invest additional resources to assess our compliance and make appropriate \n",

      "adjustments in order to comply with its requirements. If laws, regulations, rules, or agreements significantly restrict or discourage Hosts in certain jurisdictions from sharing their properties, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "While a number of cities and countries have implemented legislation to address short-term rentals, there are many others that are not yet explicitly addressing or enforcing short-term rental or long-term rental laws, and could follow suit and enact regulations with direct requirements on platforms such as Airbnb. New laws, regulations, government policies, or changes in their interpretations entail significant challenges and uncertainties. In the event of any such changes, pre-existing bookings may not be honored and current and future listings and bookings could decline significantly, and our relationship with our Hosts and guests could be negatively impacted, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, if new regulations requiring us to share Host data with governmental organizations or to ensure that Hosts have a registration or permit number before publishing their listings or some other form of regulation are implemented, our revenue from listings there may be substantially reduced due to the departure from our platform of Hosts who do not wish to share their data or to obtain a registration or permit number. A reduction in supply and cancellations could make our platform less attractive to guests, and any reduction in the number of guests could further reduce the number of Hosts on our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we seek to work with governments, we have in the past been, and are likely in the future to become, involved in disputes with government agencies regarding laws and regulations. For example, some governments have attempted to impose fines on us regarding what they contend is illegal offering of short-term accommodations in violation of applicable laws. Certain jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations that seek to impose various types of taxes, including lodging taxes, often known as transient or occupancy taxes, on our guests, collection and remittance obligations on our Hosts and/or us, and withholding obligations on us, as more fully described in our risk factor titled &#8220;Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our Hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage Hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform&#8221; and &#8220;Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.&#8221; In addition, some third parties and regulators have asserted and may in the future assert that we, through our operations, are subject to regulations with respect to short-term rentals, Host registration, licensing, and other requirements for the listing of accommodations and experiences, such as real estate broker or agent licenses, travel agency licenses, e-commerce platform operator, and insurance-related licenses. We could be held liable and incur significant financial and potential criminal penalties if we are found to have violated any of these regulations. In certain jurisdictions, we have resolved disputes concerning the application of these laws and regulations by agreeing, among other things, to remove listings from our platform at the request of government entities, to require Hosts to enter a permit or registration number or take other action before publishing listings on our platform, to share certain data with government agencies to assist in the enforcement of limits on short-term or long-term rentals as well as the enforcement of safety regulations, and to implement measures to confirm to the government that Hosts are operating in compliance with applicable law. When a government agency seeks to apply laws and regulations in a manner that limits or curtails Hosts&#8217; or guests&#8217; ability or willingness to list and search for accommodations in that particular geography, we have attempted and may continue to attempt through litigation or other means to defend against such application of laws and regulations, but have sometimes been and may continue to be unsuccessful in certain of those efforts. Further, if we or our Hosts and guests were required to comply with laws and regulations, government requests, or agreements with government agencies that adversely impact our relations with Hosts and guests, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, if we enter an agreement with a government or governmental agency to resolve a dispute, the terms of such agreement may be publicly available and could create a precedent that may lead to similar disputes in other jurisdictions and may put us in a weaker bargaining position in future disputes with other governments. \n",

As a result of such laws and regulations in connection with our insurance services, from time to time we are subject to review, inquiries or examinations by local insurance regulators to ensure compliance with such rules and regulations, including licensing requirements. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing our business practices, the Internet, e-commerce, and electronic devices, including those relating to taxation, data privacy, data security, pricing, content, advertising, discrimination, consumer protection, protection of minors, copyrights, distribution, messaging, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, electronic contracts, communications, Internet access, competition, and unfair commercial practices as well as federal, state, local, and foreign laws regulating employment, employee working conditions, including wage and hour laws, employment dispute and employee bargaining processes, collective and representative actions, employment classification, and other employment compliance requirements. Violation of these laws could subject the company to fines and penalties, including in some cases, criminal penalties. \n",

In addition, increasing governmental interest in, and public awareness of, the impacts and effects of climate change and greater emphasis on sustainability by federal, state, and international governments could lead to further regulatory efforts to address the carbon impact of housing and travel, which risks are more fully described in our risk factor titled &#8220;Growing focus on evolving environmental, social, and governance issues (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) by shareholders, customers, regulators, politicians, employees, and other stakeholders may impose additional risks and costs on our business&#8221;. \n",

In many cases, these inquiries, investigations, and proceedings can be complex, time consuming, costly to investigate, and require significant company and also management attention. For certain matters, we are implementing recommended changes to our products, operations, and compliance practices, including enabling tax collection, tax reporting, display of Host registration numbers, and removal of noncompliant listings. As our Company has grown larger, the number of bookings on our platform and brand awareness has increased, and the scope and complexity of our business have expanded, the number and significance of these claims, disputes, and proceedings have increased and we expect will continue to increase. We are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of such inquiries, investigations, and proceedings on our business, and such inquiries, investigations, and proceedings could result in damages, large fines and penalties, and require changes to our products and operations, and materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. In some instances, applicable laws and regulations do not yet exist or are being adopted and implemented to address certain aspects of our business, and such adoption or change in their interpretation could further alter or impact our business and subject us to future government inquiries, investigations, and proceedings. \n",

In the United States, we have been involved in various lawsuits concerning whether our platform is responsible for alleged wrongful conduct by Hosts who engage in short-term rentals. Claims in such cases have alleged illegal hotel conversions, real estate license requirements, violations of municipal law around short-term occupancy or rentals, unlawful evictions, or violations of lease provisions or homeowners&#8217; association rules. Legal claims have been asserted for alleged discriminatory conduct undertaken by Hosts against certain guests, and for our own platform policies or business practices. Changes to the interpretation of the applicability of fair housing, civil rights, or other statutes to our business or the conduct of our users could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as U.S. laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&#8220;DMCA&#8221;), the Stored Communications Act, and the Communications Decency Act (&#8220;CDA&#8221;), and non-U.S. laws such as the Digital Services Act (&#8220;DSA&#8221;), the EU STR Regulation and the European E-Commerce Directive and their national transpositions are interpreted by the courts or otherwise modified or amended, as our platform and services to our Hosts and guests continue to expand, and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. \n",

We also have indemnification agreements with certain of our directors, executive officers, and certain other employees that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. We may be subject to litigation stemming from these obligations. \n",

The laws governing unclaimed property matters are complex and subject to varying interpretations by companies and government authorities. An unfavorable audit could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows in future periods. \n",

Moreover, many regulatory inquiries, litigation, legal proceedings, or claims are resolved by settlements that can include both monetary and nonmonetary components. Adverse results or settlements may result in changes in our business practices in significant ways, increased operating and compliance costs, and a loss of revenue. In addition, any litigation or pre-litigation claims against us, whether or not meritorious, are time consuming, require substantial expense, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. Moreover, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. As we continue to grow, regulatory inquiries, litigation, legal proceedings, and other claims will continue to consume significant Company resources and adverse results in future matters could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes (including indirect taxes), are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;) was signed into law in the United States. Among other changes, the IRA introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax (&#8220;CAMT&#8221;) on certain corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over a three-tax year period in excess of $1 billion, and an excise tax on certain stock repurchases by certain covered corporations for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. We may be subject to a material amount of CAMT in the next several years but expect to fully utilize the corresponding credits generated from the CAMT in the subsequent following years. The United States government may enact further significant changes to the taxation of business entities including, among other changes, an increase in the corporate income tax rate or significant changes to the taxation of income derived from international operations. The likelihood of these changes being enacted or implemented is unclear. In addition, many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and states, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries and states where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. For example, in Italy, a law enacted in 2017 purports to require short-term rental platforms that process payments to withhold and remit Host income tax and collect and remit tourist tax, amongst other obligations. On December 13, 2023, without admitting any liability, Airbnb Ireland signed an agreement with the Italian Revenue Agency in settlement of the 2017-2021 audit periods for an aggregate payment of 576 million Euro ($621 million). Such agreement settles a dispute about Airbnb Ireland&#8217;s obligations to withhold and remit Host income tax, including taxes, interest, and penalties, for those relevant periods. Airbnb&#8217;s subsidiary in Italy and Airbnb Ireland continue to be, or could in the future be, subject to tax audits in Italy, including in relation to permanent establishment, transfer pricing, withholding obligations, and tourist taxes.

Work continues to be undertaken by the project with regard to each action, and new recommendations are regularly made, including proposed new legislation. Recent examples include the implementation of minimum standards in local legislation to neutralize the effects of hybrid mismatches and to appropriately tax controlled foreign companies.

As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes (including indirect taxes), including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, among others, have each proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which includes business activities on digital platforms and would likely apply to our business. In December 2022, the European Union unanimously agreed to implement the minimum tax rate legislation by December 31, 2023 in all EU member states. Several other countries including Australia, Canada, Colombia, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have also committed to implement similar legislation within the same timeframe.

For example, our 2008 to 2023 tax years remain subject to examination in the United States and California due to tax attributes and statutes of limitations, and our 2019 to 2023 tax years remain subject to examination in Ireland. We are currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) for the years 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018. We are continuing to respond to inquiries related to these examinations. In December 2020, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (&#8220;NOPA&#8221;) from the IRS for the 2013 tax year relating to the valuation of our international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. The notice proposed an increase to our U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of $1.3 billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $1.0 billion. We disagree with the proposed adjustment and intend to vigorously contest it. In January 2022, we entered into an administrative dispute process with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (&#8220;IRS Appeals&#8221;). We will continue to pursue all available remedies to resolve this dispute, including petitioning the U.S. Tax Court (&#8220;Tax Court&#8221;) for redetermination if an acceptable outcome cannot be reached with IRS Appeals, and if necessary, appealing the Tax Court&#8217;s decision to the appropriate appellate court. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position and such tax and related interest and penalties, if any, exceeds our current reserves, such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations, and any assessment of additional tax could require a significant cash payment and have a material adverse impact on our cash flow. \n",

Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future tax expense could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. For example, we have previously incurred losses in the United States and certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the United States and this could continue to happen in the future. We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities relating to indirect or other non-income taxes, as described in our risk factor titled &#8220;Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our Hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage Hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform.&#8221; Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

Some of such tax laws or regulations hold us responsible for the reporting, collection, and payment of such taxes, and such laws could be applied to us for transactions conducted in the past as well as transactions in the future. Many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce.

      "New or revised taxes and, in particular, the taxes described above and similar taxes would likely increase the price paid by guests, the cost of doing business for our Hosts, discourage Hosts and guests from using our platform, and lead to a decline in revenue, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies for tax reporting purposes, our Hosts, guests, and regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with data privacy and data security policies, notices, and laws and commence proceedings or actions against us. If we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement on the interpretation of the law, we are likely to face enforcement action, engage in litigation, face increased regulatory scrutiny, and experience an adverse impact in our relationships with governments. Our competitors may arrive at different or novel solutions to the application of taxes to analogous businesses that could cause our Hosts and guests to leave our platform in favor of conducting business on the platforms of our competitors. This uncertainty around the application of taxes and the impact of those taxes on the actual or perceived value of our platform may also cause guests to use OTAs, hotels, or other traditional travel services. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We devote significant resources, including management time, to the application and interpretation of laws and working with various jurisdictions to clarify whether taxes are applicable and the amount of taxes that apply. The application of indirect taxes to our Hosts, guests, and our platform significantly increases our operational expenses as we build the infrastructure and tools to capture data and to report, collect, and remit taxes. Even if we are able to build the required infrastructure and tools, we may not be able to complete them in a timely fashion, in particular given the speed at which regulations and their interpretations can change, which could harm our relationship with governments and our reputation, and result in enforcement actions and litigation. The lack of uniformity in the laws and regulations relating to indirect taxes as applied to our platform and to our Hosts and guests further increases the operational and financial complexity of our systems and processes, and introduces potential for errors or incorrect tax calculations, all of which are costly to our business and results of operations. Certain regulations may be so complex as to make it infeasible for us to be fully compliant. As our business operations expand or change, including as a result of introducing new or enhanced offerings, features, or due to acquisitions, the application of indirect taxes to our business and to our Hosts and guests will further change and evolve, and could further increase our liability for taxes, discourage Hosts and guests from using our platform, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. \n",
      "\n",
      "While federal net operating loss carryforwards generated on or after January 1, 2018 are not subject to expiration, the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforwards is limited to 80% of our taxable income for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that some of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future taxable income, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation&#8217;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change taxable income or income tax liabilities may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable income or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us. \n",

      "Our use of AI, machine learning, and automated decision making gives rise to legal, business, and operational risks. Legal, regulatory, social and ethical issues relating to the use of AI and machine learning technologies in our offerings and business may result in reputational harm and liability. \n",
      "\n",
      "The rapid evolution of AI and machine learning will require the application of resources to develop, test, and maintain our offerings to help ensure that AI and machine learning are implemented responsibly in order to minimize unintended or harmful impacts. Uncertainty around new and emerging AI applications may require additional investment in the development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models, and systems to test for accuracy, bias, and other variables, which are often complex, may be costly, and could impact our profit margin as we expand the use of AI technologies in our offerings. Developing, testing, and deploying AI technologies may also increase our costs due to the associated computing costs. There are significant risks involved in developing, maintaining, and deploying these technologies and there can be no assurance that the usage of such technologies will always enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability. In particular, AI or automated decision making technologies may be incorrectly designed or implemented; may be trained or reliant on incomplete, inadequate, inaccurate, biased, or otherwise poor quality data or on data to which the developer does not have sufficient rights; and/or may be adversely impacted by unforeseen defects, technical challenges, cyber security threats, or material performance issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our ability to continue to develop or use such technologies may be dependent on access to technology offered by vendors and specific third-party software and infrastructure, such as processing hardware or third-party AI models, and we cannot control the quality of vendor offerings or the availability or pricing of such third-party software and infrastructure, especially in a highly competitive environment. We face competition from other companies in our industry who use similar machine learning technologies to us. Failure to offer or deploy new AI technologies as effectively as our competitors could adversely affect our business. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, market acceptance and consumer perceptions of AI and machine learning technologies are uncertain. AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content or information that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed. Our Hosts, guests or others may rely on or use this flawed content or information to their detriment, which may expose us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, consumer complaints, legal liability, and other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The use of AI technologies presents emerging ethical and social issues, and if we enable or offer solutions that draw scrutiny or controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on our customers or on society as a whole, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, consumer complaints, legal liability, and other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business also increasingly relies on machine learning, AI, and automated decision making to improve our services and tailor our interactions with our Hosts and guests. However, in recent years the use of personal data to train, or otherwise in connection with machine learning, AI and automated decision making, has come under increased regulatory scrutiny, and governments and regulators in the United States, European Union, and other places have announced the need for greater regulation regarding the use of machine learning and AI generally. New laws, guidance, and decisions in this area may limit our ability to use our machine learning and AI, or require us to make changes to our platform or operations that may decrease our operational efficiency, result in an increase to operating costs and/or hinder our ability to improve our services. For example, certain global privacy laws regulate the use of automated decision making and may require that the existence of automated decision making be disclosed to the data subject with a meaningful explanation of the logic used in such decision making in certain circumstances, and that safeguards must be implemented to safeguard individual rights, including the right to obtain human intervention and to contest any decision. Other global privacy laws allow individuals the right to opt out of certain automated processing of personal data and create other requirements that impact automated decision-making. At the federal level, the president of the United States recently issued an Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which charges multiple agencies, including The National Institute of Standards and Technology, with producing guidelines in connection with the development and use of AI. In the European Union, there is now political agreement on the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (&#8220;EU AI Act&#8221;), which establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market. The EU AI Act is expected to enter into force in 2024, and the majority of the substantive requirements will apply two years later. The EU AI Act will apply to companies that develop, use and/or provide AI in the European Union and includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose AI and foundation models, and proposes fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover (revenue). Additionally, in September 2022, the European Commission proposed two Directives seeking to establish a harmonized civil liability regime for AI in the European Union, in order to facilitate civil claims in respect of harm caused by AI and to include AI-enabled products within the scope of the European Union&#8217;s existing strict liability regime. Once fully applicable, the EU AI Act will have a material impact on the way AI is regulated in the European Union, and together with developing guidance and/or decisions in this area, may affect our use of AI and our ability to provide, improve, or commercialize our services, and could require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes. Moreover, the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies has not been fully addressed by courts or laws or regulations, and the use or adoption of AI technologies into our offerings may result in exposure to claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation. As the legal and regulatory framework for AI and automated decision making evolves, we may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these laws or regulations, and compliance may adversely impact our operations and involve significant expenditure and resources. Any failure by us to comply may result in significant liability, potential increases in civil claims against us, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and/or increased regulation and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "We may experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations, which make it difficult to forecast our future results. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our results of operations may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. We experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. We experience seasonality in our Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV, and seasonality in Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) that is consistent with seasonality of our revenue, which has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highest in the third quarter when we have the most check-ins as it is the peak travel season for North America and EMEA. We recognize revenue upon the completion of a check-in. As our business matures, other seasonal trends may develop, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant geographic mix shift towards bookings in North America, entire homes, and non-urban destinations, all of which tend to have higher average daily rates. These trends and their impact on our average daily rate may change as customers adjust travel habits. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, our results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; reduced travel and cancellations due to other events beyond our control such as health concerns, including epidemics and pandemics, natural disasters, wars, political instability, regional hostilities or law enforcement demands, and other regulatory actions; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; global macroeconomic conditions; \n",

      "&#8226; harm to our brand or reputation; and \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, we may not accurately forecast our results of operations. In addition, we experience a difference in timing between when a booking is made and when we recognize revenue, which ordinarily occurs upon check-in. The effect of significant downturns in bookings in a particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods because of this timing in revenue recognition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, we base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates for revenue that may turn out to be inaccurate. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "We could face liability for information or content on or accessible through our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "We could face claims relating to information or content that is made available on our platform. Our platform relies upon content that is created and posted by Hosts, guests, or other third parties. Although content on our platform is typically generated by third parties, and not by us, claims of defamation, disparagement, negligence, warranty, personal harm, intellectual property infringement, or other alleged damages could be asserted against us, in addition to our Hosts and guests. While we rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses, including those provided by the DMCA, the CDA, the fair-use doctrine and various tort law defenses in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive and the DSA in the European Union and other regulations, differences between statutes, limitations on immunity or responsibility, requirements to maintain immunity or proportionate responsibility, and moderation efforts in the many jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our ability to rely on these frameworks and defenses, or create uncertainty regarding liability for information or content uploaded by Hosts and guests or otherwise contributed by third-parties to our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, regulators in the United States and in other countries may introduce new regulatory regimes that increase potential liability for information or content available on our platform. For example, in the United States, laws such as the CDA, which have previously been interpreted to provide substantial protection to interactive computer service providers, may change and become less predictable or unfavorable by legislative action or juridical interpretation. Additionally, there have been various federal legislative efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under the CDA, and current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. There may be proposed U.S. federal legislation seeking to hold platforms liable for user-generated content, including content related to short-term or long-term rentals. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. \n",
      "\n",
      "The European Union has also enhanced the regulation of digital services, and in November 2022, the DSA came into force with the majority of the substantive provisions taking effect in 2023 and 2024. The DSA governs, among other things, potential liability for illegal content on platforms, traceability of traders, and transparency reporting obligations, including information on &#8220;monthly active recipients&#8221; in the European Union. The DSA may increase compliance costs and require additional resources as well as changes to our processes and operations. Failure to comply with the DSA can result in fines of up to 6% of total annual worldwide turnover (revenue) and recipients of services have the right to seek compensation from providers in respect of damage or loss suffered due to infringement by the provider. In parallel, the Digital Markets Act (the &#8220;DMA&#8221;) came into force in November 2022 and introduced ex ante regulation of certain large online platforms. Airbnb has not been designated a gatekeeper platform for the purposes of the DMA although this could change at some point in the future. Some European jurisdictions (such as Germany) have also introduced at the national level new competition rules in relation to digital platforms that are similar in their effects to the DMA. These laws may contain certain regulatory requirements and/or obligations that could negatively impact our business. Furthermore, some of our Hosts or some of our offerings may now or in the future be subject to the European Package Travel Directive, which imposes various obligations upon package providers and upon marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers. Some European jurisdictions have also proposed or intend to pass legislation that imposes new obligations and liabilities on platforms with respect to certain types of harmful content. \n",
      "\n",
      "While the scope and timing of these proposals are currently evolving, if enacted and applied to our platform, the new rules may adversely affect our business. In countries in Asia and Latin America, new regulations covering e-commerce or digital platforms have been passed or are being drafted, and cover consumer protection, online safety, services provided, privacy and tax. Complying with these regulations may impact our supply, corporate structure, licensing and registration requirements, data sharing requirements, compliance costs and tax exposure. Further, the laws of countries in Asia and Latin America already generally provide for direct liability if a platform is involved in creating such content or has actual knowledge of the content without taking action to take it down. Additionally, laws in some Asian countries also provide for primary or secondary liability, which can include criminal liability, if a platform fails to take sufficient steps to prevent such content from being uploaded. Because liability often flows from information or content on our platform and/or services accessed through our platform, as we continue to expand our offerings and scope of business, both in terms of the range of offerings and services and geographical operations, we may face or become subject to additional or different laws and regulations. Our potential liability for information or content created by third parties and posted to our platform could require us to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to such liability, may require us to expend significant resources, may limit the desirability of our platform to Hosts and guests, may cause damage to our brand or reputation, and may cause us to incur time and costs defending such claims in litigation, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the European Union, the Consumer Rights Directive and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive harmonized consumer rights across the EU member states. Directive (EU) 2019/2161 (&#8220;Omnibus Directive&#8221;) also introduced stricter penalties (including fines) for breaches of consumer protection law, as well as additional specific information requirements for contracts concluded on online marketplaces. In 2018, the European Commission and a group of European consumer protection authorities (through the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network) investigated our customer terms and price display practices, which required us to make certain changes to our terms and price display practices. If Consumer Protection Regulators find that we are in breach of consumer protection laws, we may be fined or required to change our terms and processes, which may result in increased operational costs. Consumers and certain Consumer Protection Associations may also bring individual claims against us if they believe that our terms and/or business practices are not in compliance with local consumer protection laws. Currently, class actions may also be brought in certain countries in the European Union, and the Collective Redress Directive extends the right to collective redress across the European Union. The Collective Redress Directive replaced its predecessor in November 2020. This relatively new Directive allows for the recovery of monetary compensation by qualified entities on behalf of large classes of consumers, and greatly extends the scope to new areas, including for example misleading and comparative advertising, data privacy and data security. \n",

In addition, when Hosts cancel reservations or if we fail to provide timely refunds to guests in connection with cancellations, guest perception of the value of our platform is adversely impacted and may cause guests to not use our platform in the future. The impact of these issues may be more pronounced if we are seen to have failed to provide prompt and appropriate community support or our platform policies are perceived to be too permissive, too restrictive, or provide Hosts and/or guests with unsatisfactory resolutions. We have been the subject of media reports, social media posts, blogs, and other forums that contain allegations about our business or activity on our platform that create negative publicity. As a result of these complaints and negative publicity, some Hosts have refrained from, and may in the future refrain from, listing with us, and some guests have refrained from, and may in the future refrain from, using our platform, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "In addition, our brand and reputation could be harmed if we fail to act responsibly or are perceived as not acting responsibly, or fail to comply with regulatory requirements as interpreted by certain governments or agencies thereof, in a number of other areas, such as safety and security, data security, privacy practices, provision of information about users and activities on our platform, sustainability, human rights (including in respect of our own operations and throughout our supply chain), matters associated with our broader supply chain (including Hosts, guests, and other business partners), sustainability issues associated with human travel and migration, increased energy and water consumption, diversity, non-discrimination, and support for employees and local communities. Media, legislative, or government scrutiny around our Company, including the perceived impact on affordable housing and over-tourism, neighborhood nuisance, privacy practices, provision of information as requested by certain governments or agencies thereof, content on our platform, business practices and strategic plans, impact of travel on the climate and local environment, and public health policies that may cause geopolitical backlash, our business partners, private companies where we have minority investments, and our practices relating to our platform, offerings, employees, competition, litigation, and response to regulatory activity, could adversely affect our brand and our reputation with our Hosts, guests, and communities. Social media compounds the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated and the speed with which such negative publicity may spread. Any resulting damage to our brand or reputation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "In addition, we rely on our Hosts and guests to provide trustworthy reviews and ratings that our Hosts or guests may rely upon to help decide whether or not to book a particular listing or accept a particular booking and that we use to enforce quality standards. We rely on these reviews to further strengthen trust among members of our community. Our Hosts and guests may be less likely to rely on reviews and ratings if they believe that our review system does not generate trustworthy reviews and ratings. We have procedures in place to combat fraud or abuse of our review system, but we cannot guarantee that these procedures are or will be effective. In addition, if our Hosts and guests do not leave reliable reviews and ratings, other potential Hosts or guests may disregard those reviews and ratings, and our systems that use reviews and ratings to enforce quality standards would be less effective, which could reduce trust within our community and damage our brand and reputation, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Meeting the community support expectations of our Hosts and guests requires significant time and resources from our community support team and significant investment in staffing, technology, including automation and machine learning to improve efficiency, infrastructure, policies, and community support tools. The failure to develop the appropriate technology, infrastructure, policies, and community support tools, or to manage or properly train our community support team, could compromise our ability to resolve questions and complaints quickly and effectively. The number of our Hosts and guests has grown significantly and such growth, as well as any future growth, will put additional pressure on our community support organization and our technology organization. In addition, as we service a global customer base and continue to grow outside of North America and Europe, we need to be able to provide effective support that meets our Hosts&#8217; and guests&#8217; needs and languages globally at scale. Our service is powered, in large part, based on complex algorithms that map to our business forecasts. Any volatility in those forecasts could lead to staffing gaps that could impact the quality of our service.

We may make payouts for property damage claims under our Host Damage Protection program, which we account for as consideration paid to a customer and is also generally treated as a reduction in revenue. A robust community support effort is costly, and we expect such cost to continue to rise in the future as we grow our business. We have historically seen a significant number of community support inquiries from Hosts and guests.

The actions of Hosts, guests, and other third parties have resulted and can further result in fatalities, injuries, other bodily harm, fraud, invasion of privacy, property damage, discrimination, brand, and reputational damage, which have created and could continue to create potential legal or other substantial liabilities for us. We do not verify the identity of all of our Hosts and guests nor do we verify or screen third parties who may be present during a reservation made through our platform. Our identity verification processes rely on, among other things, information provided by Hosts and guests, and our ability to validate that information and the effectiveness of third-party service providers that support our verification processes may be limited. In addition, we do not currently and may not in the future require users to re-verify their identity following their successful completion of the initial verification process. Certain verification processes, including legacy verification processes on which we previously relied, may be less reliable than others. We screen against certain regulatory, terrorist, and sanctions watch lists, conduct criminal background checks for certain U.S. Hosts, U.S. guests, and Hosts in India, and conduct additional screening processes to flag and investigate suspicious activities. These processes are beneficial but not exhaustive and have limitations due to a variety of factors, including laws and regulations that prohibit or limit our ability to conduct effective background checks in some jurisdictions, the unavailability and inaccuracy of information, and the inability of our systems to detect all suspicious activity. There can be no assurances that these measures will significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on our platform. The criminal background checks for certain U.S. Hosts, U.S. guests, and Hosts in India, and other screening processes rely on, among other things, information provided by Hosts and guests, our ability to validate that information, the accuracy, completeness, and availability of the underlying information relating to criminal records, the digitization of certain records, the evolving regulatory landscape in this area such as in the data privacy and data security space, and on the effectiveness of third-party service providers that may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility, and we do not run criminal background checks and other screening processes on third parties who may be present during a reservation made through our platform. \n",

We have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to independently verify the location, safety, or suitability of experiences for individual guests, the suitability, qualifications, or credentials of experiences Hosts, or the qualifications of individual experiences guests. In the limited circumstances where we have undertaken the verification or screening of certain aspects of Host qualifications, listings or experiences, the scope of such processes may be limited and rely on, among other things, information provided by Hosts and guests and the ability of our internal teams or third-party vendors to adequately conduct such verification or screening practices. In addition, we have not in the past taken and may not in the future take steps to re-verify or re-screen Host qualifications, listings, or experiences following initial review. We have in the past relied, and may in the future, rely on Hosts and guests to disclose information relating to their listings and experiences and such information may be inaccurate or incomplete. We have created policies and standards to respond to issues reported with listings, but certain listings may pose heightened safety risks to individual users because those issues have not been reported to us or because our customer support team has not taken the requisite action based on our policies. We rely, at least in part, on reports of issues from Hosts and guests to investigate and enforce many of our policies and standards. In addition, our policies may not contemplate certain safety risks posed by listings or individual Hosts or guests or may not sufficiently address those risks. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have also faced civil litigation, regulatory investigations, and inquiries involving allegations of, among other things, unsafe or unsuitable listings, discriminatory policies, data processing, practices, or behavior on and off our platform or by Hosts, guests, and third parties, general misrepresentations regarding the safety or accuracy of offerings on our platform, and other Host, guest, or third-party actions that are criminal, violent, inappropriate, dangerous, or fraudulent. While we recognize that we need to continue to build trust and invest in innovations that will support trust when it comes to our policies, tools, and procedures to help protect Hosts, guests, and the communities in which our Hosts operate, we may not be successful in doing so. Similarly, listings that are inaccurate, of a lower than expected quality, or that do not comply with our policies may harm guests and public perception of the quality and safety of listings on our platform and materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "If Hosts, guests, or third parties engage in criminal activity, misconduct, fraudulent, negligent, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, consumers may not consider our platform and the listings on our platform safe, and we may receive \n",
      "\n",
      "negative media coverage, or be subject to involvement in a government investigation concerning such activity, which could adversely impact our brand and reputation, and lower the adoption rate of our platform. For example: \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; there have been shootings, fatalities, and other criminal or violent acts on properties booked on our platform, including as a result of unsanctioned house parties; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; there have been incidents of sexual violence against Hosts, guests, and third parties, and we have seen higher incident rates of such conduct associated with private room and shared space listings; \n",

      "The methods used by perpetrators of fraud and other misconduct are complex and constantly evolving, and our trust and security measures have been, and may currently or in the future be, insufficient to detect and help prevent all fraudulent activity and other misconduct; for example: \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; there have been incidents where Hosts have misrepresented the quality and location or existence of their properties, in some instances to send guests to different and inferior properties; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; there have been incidents where guests have caused substantial property damage to listings or misrepresented the purpose of their stay and used listings for unauthorized or inappropriate conduct including parties, sex work, drug-related activities, or to perpetrate criminal activities; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; there have been instances where users with connected or duplicate accounts have circumvented or manipulated our systems, in an effort to evade account restrictions, create false reviews, or engage in fraud or other misconduct; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; there have been incidents where fraudsters have created fake guest accounts, fake Host accounts, or both, to perpetrate financial fraud; and \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; situations have occurred where Hosts or guests mistakenly or unintentionally provide malicious third parties access to their accounts, which has allowed those third parties to take advantage of our Hosts and guests. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#160; \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, certain regions where we operate have higher rates of violent crime or varying safety requirements, which can lead to more safety and security incidents, and may adversely impact the adoption of our platform in those regions and elsewhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "If criminal, inappropriate, fraudulent, or other negative incidents continue to occur due to the conduct of Hosts, guests, or third parties, our ability to attract and retain Hosts and guests would be harmed, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. Such incidents have prompted, and may in the future prompt, stricter home sharing regulations or regulatory inquiries into our platform policies and business practices. In the United States and other countries, we have seen listings being used for parties in violation of Airbnb&#8217;s policies which have in some cases resulted in neighborhood disruption or violence. Further, claims have been asserted against us from our Hosts, guests, and third parties for compensation due to fatalities, accidents, injuries, assaults, theft, property damage, data privacy and data security issues, fraudulent listings, and other incidents that are caused by other Hosts, guests, or third parties while using our platform. These claims subject us to potentially significant liability and increase our operating costs and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have obtained some third-party insurance, which is subject to certain conditions and exclusions, for claims and losses incurred based on incidents related to bookings on our platform. Our third-party insurance, which may or may not be applicable to all claims, may be inadequate to fully cover alleged claims of liability, investigation costs, defense costs, and/or payouts. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant time and cost investigating and defending against them. As we expand our offerings, or if the quantity or severity of incidents increases, our insurance rates and our financial exposure will grow, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Measures that we are taking to improve the trust and safety of our platform may cause us to incur significant expenditures and may not be successful. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have taken and continue to take measures to improve the trust and safety on our platform, combat fraudulent activities and other misconduct and improve community trust, such as requiring identity and other information from Hosts and guests, attempting to confirm the location of listings, removing suspected fraudulent listings or listings repeatedly reported by guests to be significantly not as described, and removing Hosts and guests who fail to comply with our policies. These measures are long-term investments in our business and the trust and safety of our community. However, some of these measures increase friction on our platform by increasing the number of steps required to list or book, which reduces Host and guest activity on our platform, and could materially adversely affect our business. Implementing the trust and safety initiatives we have announced, which include limited verification of Hosts and listings, restrictions on &#8220;party&#8221; houses, restrictions on certain types of bookings, and our neighbor hotline, or other initiatives, has caused and will continue to cause us to incur significant ongoing expenses and may result in fewer listings and bookings or reduced Host and guest retention, which could also materially adversely affect our business. As we operate a global platform, the timing and implementation of these measures will vary across geographies and may be restricted by local law requirements. We have invested and plan to continue to invest significantly in the trust and safety of our platform, but there can be no assurances that these measures will be successful, significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on or off our platform, or be sufficient to protect our reputation in the event of such activity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, we have established community standards, but those standards may not always be effectively enforced, communicated to, or consistently understood by all parts of our community. For example, while we require and communicate to Hosts and guests to make certain commitments with respect to diversity and belonging when they join Airbnb, these standards and requirements are not always well understood by all parts of our community. As a result, Hosts and guests may be surprised or disappointed when their expectations are not met. \n",

      "Growing focus on evolving environmental, social, and governance issues by shareholders, customers, regulators, politicians, employees, and other stakeholders may impose additional risks and costs on our business. \n",
      "\n",
      "ESG matters have become an area of growing and evolving focus among our shareholders and other stakeholders, including among customers, employees, regulators, politicians, and the general public in the United States and abroad. In particular, companies, including Airbnb, face heightened expectations with respect to their practices, disclosures, and performance in relation to environmental sustainability, climate change, biodiversity, diversity, equity and inclusion, human rights, energy and water consumption, human capital management, data privacy and security, and supply chains (including human rights issues), among other topics. \n",
      "\n",
      "The current regulatory landscape regarding climate change and other ESG-related matters, both within the United States and in many other locations where we operate worldwide, is evolving at a pace, and is likely to continue to develop in ways, that require our business to adapt and require us to make certain disclosures regarding our operations and our commitments. Many U.S. states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, including disclosure requirements relating thereto, and some U.S. states, for example, California, have also adopted various ESG-related efforts, initiatives and requirements. As a result, governments are, and may continue to, enact new laws and regulations and/or view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past, including laws and regulations which are responsive to ESG trends or otherwise seek to reduce the carbon emissions relating to travel and set minimum energy efficiency requirements, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The legislative landscape continues to be in a state of constant change as well as legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on our business in the aggregate. We incur significant expenses and commit significant resources so that our platform can comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully implement technical upgrades and other system implementations in a timely manner since implementations often involve building new infrastructure and tools, which contain the inherent risk of unplanned errors and defects, and in certain instances we may be unable to respond to legislation or regulation in a way that fully mitigates any negative impacts our business. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are committed to maintaining strong relationships with all of our key stakeholders, including our Hosts, guests, the communities within which we operate in, employees, and shareholders and we have taken and continue to take steps to serve each of our stakeholder groups. We also endeavor to maintain productive relationships with regulators and other constituencies with whom we engage. Notwithstanding our commitments to stakeholders and intentions with respect to other constituencies, if we fail to meet rapidly evolving investor, regulator, and other stakeholder expectations on ESG matters, if we are perceived not to have responded appropriately or in a timely manner to ESG issues that are material, or perceived to be material, to our business (including failing to pursue or achieve our stated goals, targets and objectives within the timelines we announce, failing to satisfy reporting and disclosure expectations or requirements, or if there are real or perceived inaccuracies in the data and information we report or if we are exposed to greenwashing initiatives), if we fail to accurately report ESG-related data or fail to accurately report the challenges associated with our ESG initiatives or the degree to which we will or will not be able to meet our ESG-related commitments, or if we fail to fully understand, reflect, disclose, mitigate or manage risks associated with environmental or social matters, we may experience harm to our brand and reputation, adverse press coverage, a reduction in our attractiveness as an investment, greater regulatory scrutiny and potential legal claims, greater difficulties in attracting and retaining customers and talent, increased costs associated with our legal compliance, insurance, or access to capital, and as a consequence, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or stock price could be materially adversely affected. We also expect to incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with our various ESG commitments and reporting obligations. Certain market participants, including major institutional investors and capital providers, use third-party benchmarks and scores to assess companies&#8217; ESG profiles in making investment or voting decisions, and unfavorable such scores could negatively impact us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some external parties oppose companies&#8217; efforts on certain ESG-related matters. Both advocates and opponents to certain ESG matters are increasingly resorting to a range of activism forms, including media campaigns and litigation, to advance their perspectives. To the extent we are subject to such activism, it may require us to incur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and other stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risks identified in this risk factor. \n",
      "\n",
      "We track certain operational metrics, which are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our stock price, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We track certain operational metrics, including metrics such as Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, average daily rates (&#8220;ADR&#8221;), active listings, active bookers, Hosts, and guest arrivals, which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools are subject to a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations globally. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV metrics are adjusted for cancellations and alterations that happen in the reporting period. However, cancellations and alterations for bookings made in the reporting period can occur beyond the current reporting period. This results in a reported amount of Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV in the quarter of the booking for which all of the bookings may ultimately not result in check-ins, and subsequently reduces our Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV metrics in subsequent quarters when we experience cancellations. Cancellations and alterations to previously booked trips increased dramatically after the COVID-19 outbreak, as guests were either unable to travel or uncomfortable traveling. If we experience high levels of cancellations in the future, our performance and related business metrics will be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "The calculation of Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings requires the ongoing collection of data on new offerings that are added to our platform over time. Our business is complex, and the methodology used to calculate Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings may require future adjustments to accurately represent the full value of new offerings. \n",
      "\n",
      "An active booker is a unique guest who has booked a stay or experience in a given time period. Certain individuals may have more than one guest account and therefore may be counted more than once in our count of active bookers. We count the number of Hosts on our platform based on the number of Hosts with an available listing as of a certain date. Some individuals may have more than one Host account and therefore may be counted more than once as Hosts. \n",

      "Our metrics, including our reported Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings, may include fraudulent bookings, accounts, and other activities that have not been flagged by our trust and safety teams or identified by our machine learning algorithms or not yet addressed by our operational teams, which could mean these activities on our site are not identified or addressed in a timely manner or at all, reducing the accuracy of our metrics. Further, any such fraudulent activity, along with associated refunds and cancellations, would reduce our metrics, in particular Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings, in the quarter in which it is discovered. Limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operational metrics are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive these metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, our stock price could decline, we may be subject to stockholder litigation, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "\n",
      "Data privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations are complex, and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, other processing, and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs or have other material adverse effects on our business. We collect, store, handle, transmit, use, and otherwise process personal data, such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and identity verification information (for example, government issued identification or passport), as well as credit card or other financial information, from and about Hosts and guests, as well as our employees, job applicants, contractors and representatives of our third-party vendors, and other companies we do business with. We also depend on third-party vendors to operate our business, a number of which process data on our behalf. We and our vendors are subject to a variety of state, federal, and foreign data privacy laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements, including those that generally require that we implement reasonable measures to keep such information secure and otherwise restrict the ways in which such information can be collected and used. These requirements, and their application, interpretation, and amendment are constantly evolving and developing. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the European Union and the UK, we are subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the &#8220;EU GDPR&#8221;) and to the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (the &#8220;UK GDPR&#8221;), respectively (the EU GDPR and UK GDPR together referred to as the &#8220;GDPR&#8221;), both of which have resulted, and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies like ours. The GDPR regulates our collection, control, processing, sharing, disclosure, and other use of data that can directly or indirectly identify a living individual (&#8220;personal data&#8221;), and imposes stringent data protection requirements with significant penalties, and the risk of civil litigation, for noncompliance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since we are subject to the supervision of relevant data protection authorities under both the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, we could be fined under each of those regimes independently in respect of the same breach. Penalties for certain breaches are up to the greater of 20 million Euro or GBP 17.5 million, or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. It may also lead to civil litigation, with the risks of damages or injunctive relief, or regulatory orders adversely impacting the ways in which our business can use personal data. Further, the UK framework may in the future start to diverge from the EU framework, and these changes may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. \n",
      "\n",
      "From time to time we receive correspondence from regulators including the Data Protection Commission, our lead EU data protection regulator, regarding our personal data processing activities. We have been and are currently subject to a small number of statutory inquiries in respect of data processing under the GDPR, although we do not consider this particularly unusual for a business of our size and the level of personal data processed. To date, we have not received any fines in respect of such inquiries and have in place an internal process to review and process such inquiries to ensure we respond appropriately and update our privacy compliance with any findings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;) and the UK. Case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union (&#8220;CJEU&#8221;) states that reliance on the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism) alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In October 2022, President Biden signed an Executive Order on &#8216;Enhancing Safeguards for United States Intelligence Activities&#8217; which introduced new redress mechanisms and binding safeguards to address the concerns raised by the CJEU in relation to data transfers from the EEA to the United States under the standard contractual clauses, and which formed the basis of the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework (&#8220;DPF&#8221;), as released in December 2022. The European Commission adopted its Adequacy Decision in relation to the DPF in July 2023 rendering the DPF effective as an EU GDPR transfer mechanism to U.S. entities self-certified under the DPF. In October 2023, the UK Extension to the DPF came into effect (as approved by the UK Government) as a UK GDPR data transfer mechanism to U.S. entities self-certified under the UK Extension to the DPF. \n",

      "We currently rely on the EU standard contractual and the UK Addendum to the EU clauses standard contractual clauses and the UK International Data Transfer Agreement as relevant to transfer personal data outside the EEA and the UK with respect to both intragroup and third-party transfer. We expect the existing legal complexity and uncertainty regarding international personal data transfers to continue. In particular, we expect the DPF Adequacy Decision to be challenged and international transfers to the United States and to other jurisdictions more generally to continue to be subject to enhanced scrutiny by regulators. As the regulatory guidance and enforcement landscape in relation to data transfers continue to develop, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, and/or regulatory investigations or fines, we may have to stop using certain tools and vendors and make other operational changes, including updating agreements or implementing additional safeguards which could otherwise affect the manner in which we provide our services and our ability to provide our services; and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "\n",
      "Additionally, we note that as the use of AI continues to grow, data protection regulators may take an increased interest in how we process personal data of our users and/ or hosts. This may mean that regulators seek advance engagement with businesses like ours in respect of certain types of data processing. This may affect our use of AI and our ability to provide, improve or commercialize our services effectively and efficiently and result in increased costs. \n",

      "In the United States, there are numerous federal and state data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, use, storage, sharing, transmission, and other processing of personal information, including federal and state data privacy laws, data breach notification laws, electronic communications laws, and marketing and consumer protection laws. For example, the Federal Trade Commission and state regulators enforce a variety of data privacy issues, such as misrepresentations in privacy policies or failures to appropriately protect information about individuals, as unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act or similar state laws. Additionally, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) and its implementing regulations, which restrict certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. \n",

      "The U.S. government, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. In addition, numerous states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and processing of state residents&#8217; personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;) took effect in January 2020. The CCPA established a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours, and may continue to require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. The CCPA provided new and enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording consumers the right to access and delete their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. The CCPA also prohibits covered businesses from discriminating against consumers (for example, charging more for services) for exercising any of their CCPA rights. The CCPA imposes severe statutory damages and could lead to injunctive relief or agreed settlements providing for ongoing audit and reporting requirements, as well as a private right of action, for certain data breaches. This private right of action has increased the risks associated with data breach litigation. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;). The CPRA went into effect in January 2023. The CPRA modifies and expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements that may impact our business, and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements. In addition, the enactment of the CCPA is prompting a wave of similar legislative developments in other states, which creates the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws. For example, since the CCPA went into effect, comprehensive privacy statutes that share similarities with the CCPA are now in effect and enforceable in Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut, and will be taking effect in other U.S. states in 2024 and beyond. Many other states are currently reviewing or proposing the need for greater regulation of the collection, sharing, use and other processing of information related to individuals for advertising purposes or otherwise, and there remains increased interest at the federal level as well. Together, these laws will add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources to compliance programs and cyber security, could impact strategies and availability of previously useful data, and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Various other governments and consumer agencies around the world have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices and many have enacted different and often contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically. Compliance with numerous and contradictory requirements of different jurisdictions is particularly difficult and costly for an online business such as ours, which collects personal information from Hosts, guests, and other individuals in multiple jurisdictions. If any jurisdiction in which we operate adopts new laws or changes its interpretation of its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or localization such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we could risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. As in many cases these laws are relatively new and the interpretation and application of these laws is uncertain there may be litigation, claims and enforcement relating to data privacy and the processing of personal data may involve new interpretations of privacy laws. For example, there has been a noticeable increase in class actions in the U.S. where plaintiffs have utilized a variety of laws, including state wiretapping laws, in relation to the use of tracking technologies, such as cookies and pixels. \n",

      "When we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from, or give data access to, government agencies, including tax authorities, state and city regulators, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence agencies, our Hosts, guests, and data privacy and security regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with data privacy and data security policies, notices, and laws, which could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions. Conversely, if we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement, such as on the interpretation of the law, we are likely to face enforcement action from such government, engage in litigation, face increased regulatory scrutiny, and experience an adverse impact on our relationship with governments or our ability to offer our services within certain jurisdictions. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with consumer protection, data privacy or data security laws, rules, and regulations; policies; industry standards; or enforcement notices and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit) could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, government agencies, or others. We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, and diversion of internal resources. We could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages or fines or be required to make changes to our business. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant negative publicity, and an erosion of trust.

These cybersecurity risks are from diverse threat actors, such as state-sponsored organizations, opportunistic hackers and hacktivists, as well as through diverse attack vectors, such as social engineering/phishing, company insiders, suppliers or providers, and as a result of human or technological error, including misconfigurations, bugs, or other vulnerabilities in software and hardware. The evolution of technology systems introduces ever more complex security risks that are difficult to predict and defend against, including AI. Further, there was a surge in widespread cyber-attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and geopolitical conflicts continue to increase and exacerbate our cybersecurity risks and potential for cybersecurity incidents. An increasing number of companies, including those with significant online operations, have recently disclosed breaches of their security, some of which involved sophisticated tactics and techniques allegedly attributable to organized criminal enterprises or nation-state actors. The techniques used by threat actors to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are unknown until launched against a target. As such, we cannot ensure that we will be able to anticipate, investigate, remediate, or recover from future attacks or incidents, or to avoid material impact to our IT Systems, Confidential Information or business. There can also be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our IT Systems and Confidential Information. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, with a large geographically disparate employee base, we are not immune from the possibility of a malicious insider compromising our information systems and infrastructure. This risk has grown in light of the greater adoption of remote work. Remote and hybrid working arrangements at our Company (and at many third-party providers) also increase cybersecurity risks due to the challenges associated with managing remote computing assets and security vulnerabilities that are present in many non-corporate and home networks. We also have a distributed community support organization including third-party providers that have access to personal information and systems. We and other companies in our industry have dealt with incidents involving such insiders exfiltrating and stealing Confidential Information and illegally diverting funds. We and other companies in our industry have also dealt with third parties and insiders manipulating information (e.g., reviews). No series of measures can fully safeguard against a sufficiently determined and skilled insider threat. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, bad actors have targeted and will continue to target our Hosts and guests directly with attempts to breach the security of their accounts or management systems, such as through social engineering or phishing attacks where a third party attempts to infiltrate our systems or acquire information by posing as a legitimate inquiry or electronic communication, which are fraudulent identity theft schemes designed to appear as legitimate communications from us or from our Hosts or guests, partners, or vendors. We have seen many instances of our Hosts and guests falling prey to such schemes, which result in their accounts being taken over by fraudsters intent on perpetrating fraud against them, other users, and our platform. Bad actors may also employ other schemes aimed at defrauding our Hosts or guests in ways that we may not anticipate or be able to adequately guard against. Even if phishing and spamming attacks and other fraud schemes are not carried out through our IT Systems, victims may nevertheless seek recovery from us. Because of our prominence, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific scheme or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of our offerings, services, and IT Systems to the satisfaction of our Hosts and guests may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing Hosts and guests and attract new Hosts and \n",

      "Generally, our practice is to encrypt certain sensitive data when it is in transit and at rest. However, advances in computer capabilities, increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists, new discoveries in the field of cryptography and AI, or other developments may result in our failure or inability to adequately protect sensitive data. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our IT Systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic intrusions that our security measures may not detect. We and certain of our third-party service providers have experienced cyberattacks and other security incidents in the past, and we expect such attacks and incidents to continue in varying degrees. Any cyberattack or security incident threatens the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our IT Systems and Confidential Information and could result in the misappropriation of Confidential Information and could materially adversely affect our operations, financial condition, IT Systems or those of our Hosts and guests, or could otherwise cause damage to our reputation and business. Further, the ability to bypass our information security controls could degrade our trust and safety programs, which could expose individuals to a risk of physical harm or violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a breach of our IT Systems and we know or suspect that certain Confidential Information has been exfiltrated, accessed, or used inappropriately, we may need to inform privacy regulators across the world, as well as our employees and the Hosts or guests whose data was stolen, accessed, or misused. This may subject us to significant regulatory fines and penalties. Further, under certain regulatory schemes, such as the CCPA, we may be liable for statutory damages on a per breached record basis, irrespective of any actual damages or harm to the individual. This means that in the event of a breach we could face government scrutiny or consumer class actions alleging statutory damages amounting to hundreds of millions, and possibly billions of dollars. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on third-party service providers, including financial institutions, to process some of our data and that of our Hosts and guests, including payment information, and successful security incidents that disrupt or result in unauthorized access to third-party IT Systems of data processed therein could have adverse consequences for us similar to an incident directly on our IT Systems, including financially and operationally. We have acquired and will continue to acquire companies whose IT Systems are vulnerable to security incidents and have vulnerabilities, and we may be responsible for any security incidents of these newly acquired companies. While we conduct due diligence of these companies, we do not have access to the full operating history of the companies, including measures implemented to protect their IT Systems and Confidential Information, and cannot be certain there have not been security incidents prior to or vulnerabilities that still exist at the time of our acquisition, which exposes us to significant cybersecurity, operational and financial risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "We expend, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources to protect our IT Systems and Confidential Information and remediate or recover from cyberattacks and security incidents. However, regulators and complainants may not deem our efforts sufficient, and regardless of the expenditure, the risk of security incidents cannot be fully mitigated. We have a heightened risk of cyberattacks and security incidents due to some of our operations being located in certain international jurisdictions. Any actual or alleged security breaches or alleged impact to the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of our IT Systems or Confidential Information or alleged violations of federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations relating to data privacy and data security could result in mandated user notifications, legal claims or proceedings (such as class actions), government investigations and enforcement actions, significant fines, and expenditures; divert management&#8217;s attention from operations; incur significant incident response, system restoration, or remediation and future compliance costs; deter people from using our platform; damage our brand and reputation; force us to cease operations for some length of time; and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Defending against claims or litigation based on any security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, will be costly and may cause reputation harm. We cannot guarantee that any costs and liabilities incurred in relation to an attack or incident will be covered by our existing insurance policies or that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all. Therefore, the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, denial of coverage as to any specific claim, or any change or cessation in our insurance policies and coverages, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and software, including algorithms that incorporate machine learning and exhibit characteristics of AI. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform, to effectively implement updates to our systems and to appropriately monitor and maintain our systems. Our (or our suppliers&#8217; or services providers&#8217;) IT Systems, including open source software that is incorporated into the code, may now or in the future contain a range of cybersecurity risks and threats, including bugs, vulnerabilities, or backdoors. Some errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or backdoors in our IT Systems have not been and may not be discovered until after the code has been released. We have, from time to time, found defects or errors in our IT Systems and software limitations that have resulted in, and may discover additional issues in the future that could result in, platform unavailability or system disruption, or the inability of our systems to implement timely updates that are required for regulatory compliance. For example, defects or errors have resulted in and could result in the delay in making payments to Hosts or overpaying or underpaying Hosts, which would impact our cash position and may cause Hosts to lose trust in our payment operations. Any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or backdoors discovered in our IT Systems released to production or found in third-party software, including open source software, that is incorporated into our code, any misconfigurations of our IT Systems, or any unintended interactions between IT Systems could result in poor system performance, an interruption in the availability of our platform, incorrect payments, incorrect calculations, search ranking problems, Host account takeovers, fraudulent listings, issues with chatbot behavior, inadvertent failure to effectively comply with legal, tax, or regulatory requirements, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of existing and potential Hosts and guests, loss of revenue, liability for damages, a failure to comply with certain legal or tax reporting obligations, and regulatory inquiries or other proceedings, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Since our founding, we have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our platform. If our systems and network infrastructure cannot be expanded or are not scaled to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, decreased customer satisfaction, and delays in the introduction of new offerings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our IT Systems and operations, including those provided by third-party service providers, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, computer viruses, earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, and similar events. For example, we have significant operations in San Francisco, which is built on a high-risk liquefaction zone and is near major earthquake fault lines. In addition, Northern California has recently experienced, and may continue to experience power outages during the fire season and our headquarters does not have power generator backup to maintain full business continuity. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our headquarters, any third-party cloud hosting facilities, or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and result in lengthy interruptions or delays of our platform and services. \n",

      "Our IT Systems and operations are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, and similar misconduct from external sources and malicious insiders. We will not always be successful in preventing, detecting, investigating, and remediating attacks on our IT Systems, and any such attack could cause significant interruptions in our operations. For instance, from time to time, we have experienced distributed denial-of-service type attacks on our IT Systems that have made portions of our platform slow or unavailable for periods of time. There are numerous other potential forms of attack, such as social engineering/phishing, account takeovers, malicious code injections, ransomware or other extortion-based attempts, and the attempted use of our platform to launch a denial-of-service attack against another party, each of which could cause significant interruptions in our operations or involve us in legal or regulatory proceedings. Reductions in the availability and response time of our online platform could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such attack on our systems and measures we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customers. These issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and the variety of services we offer, and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced and available. Successful attacks could adversely impact the availability, integrity or confidentiality of our IT Systems, result in legal claims or proceedings (such as class actions), regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, fines and penalties, negative publicity and damage to our reputation, could prevent consumers from booking or visiting our platform during the attack, and/or could result in significant incident response, system restoration, or remediation and future compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "In the event of certain IT System failures, we may not be able to switch to back-up systems immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged. We have experienced IT System failures from time to time. In addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a significant amount of consumer questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our community support team. Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate and significant loss of revenue, an increase in community support costs, harm to our reputation, and could result in some consumers switching to our competitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system failures, our brand and reputation could be permanently and significantly harmed, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. While we have taken and continue to take steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our IT Systems, these steps are expensive and may not be completely effective in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur. \n",

If the number of consumers using our platform increases substantially, or if critical third-party systems stop operating as designed, we may need to significantly upgrade, expand, or repair our transaction and payment processing systems, financial and accounting systems, and other infrastructure. We may not be able to upgrade our IT Systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner, and depending on the systems affected, our transaction and payment processing, and financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

We support our Host community by maintaining a variety of Host protection programs, such as AirCover for Hosts, which includes our Host Liability Insurance, Experiences Liability Insurance, and our Host Damage Protection program. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if (i) cost per claim, premiums or the number of claims significantly exceeds our expectations; (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits; (iii) our insurance providers become insolvent or otherwise fail to pay on our insurance claims; (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is denied by or disputed by our insurance providers; or (v) the number of claims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historic averages. Our spending for insurance has increased as our business has grown and losses from covered claims have increased. Premiums have increased as a result, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased difficulty in obtaining appropriate policy limits and levels of coverage at a reasonable cost and with reasonable terms and conditions. Our costs for obtaining these policies will continue to increase as our business grows and continues to evolve. Furthermore, as our business continues to develop \n",

We and our Hosts are insured parties, and landlords, homeowners, or condo-owners associations, and any other similar entities, are additional insured parties. However, these insurance programs may not provide coverage for certain types of claims, including those relating to contagious diseases such as COVID-19, and may be insufficient to fully cover costs of investigation, costs of defense, and payments or judgments arising from covered claims.

Our captive insurance subsidiary is a party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a portion of the risk from our insurance providers to the captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves. As our business continues to develop and diversify, we may choose to or have to transfer more risk to our captive insurance subsidiary as it may become more difficult to obtain insurance with current retentions or deductibles and with similar terms to cover our exposure. Our insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and other associated expenses, such as defense costs retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary. These amounts are based on third-party actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data.

      "Since June 2022, guests in certain jurisdictions have had the opportunity to purchase travel insurance when they make a booking. Over time, we expect to make travel insurance available to guests in additional countries. In the United States, travel insurance products are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which we transact business by state insurance departments. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of consumers. States have also adopted legislation defining and prohibiting unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts and practices in the business of insurance that may apply to insurance agencies. Noncompliance with any of such state statutes may subject us to regulatory action by the relevant state insurance regulator, and, in certain states, private litigation. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that any new laws, rules or regulations, or unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules or regulations, may have on our business and financial results. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and independent agents. State insurance regulators may also conduct periodic examinations, the results of which could give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action. Similarly, travel insurance products are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the applicable regulators in the United Kingdom and the European Union. The failure to comply with applicable state and foreign laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against us by governmental agencies and/or consumers which, if material, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Generally speaking, the strength of the U.S. dollar adversely impacts the portion of our revenue that is generated in foreign currencies when converted into the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 52% of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We also have foreign exchange risk with respect to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of Hosts and guests, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, and our financial results are affected by the remeasurement and translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars, which is reflected in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Furthermore, our platform generally enables guests to make payments in the currency of their choice to the extent that the currency is supported by Airbnb, which may not match the currency in which the Host elects to get paid. In those cases, we bear the currency risk of both the guest payment as well as the Host payment due to timing differences in such payments. We may also risk currency rate and logic confusion by Hosts or guests if they do not understand the currency shown. \n",

      "In the first quarter of 2023, we initiated a foreign exchange cash flow hedging program to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations on revenue. However, hedging transactions may not successfully mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations, and our hedging positions may be partial or may not exist at all in the future. While we have and may choose to enter into transactions to hedge portions of our revenue and balance sheet exposures in the future, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate exposure. \n",

The remainder of our traffic comes through direct or unpaid channels, which include brand marketing and search engine optimization (&#8220;SEO&#8221;). A critical factor in attracting Hosts and guests to our platform is how prominently listings are displayed in response to search queries for key search terms. The success of home sharing and our brand has led to increased costs for relevant keywords as our competitors competitively bid on our keywords, including our brand name. Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels. However, we may not be successful at our efforts to drive traffic growth cost-effectively. If we are not able to effectively increase our traffic growth without increases in spend on performance marketing, we may need to increase our performance marketing spend in the future, including in response to increased spend on performance marketing from our competitors, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "The technology that powers much of our performance marketing is increasingly subject to strict regulation, and regulatory or legislative changes could adversely impact the effectiveness of our performance marketing efforts and, as a result, our business. For example, we rely on the placement and use of &#8220;cookies&#8221; &#8212; text files stored on a Host or guest&#8217;s web browser or device &#8212; and related and similar technologies to support tailored marketing to consumers. Many countries have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, regulations governing the use of cookies and similar technologies, and individuals may be required to &#8220;opt-in&#8221; to the placement of cookies used for purposes of marketing. For example, we are subject to evolving EU and UK privacy laws on cookies, tracking technologies, and e-marketing. In the European Union and United Kingdom under national laws derived from the ePrivacy Directive, informed consent is often required for the placement of a cookie or similar technology on a user&#8217;s device and for direct electronic marketing. The GDPR also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. The GDPR and similar laws also strictly regulate our use of personal data for marketing purposes. Recent European court and regulatory decisions as well as guidance have driven increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies, in particular in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem. We are seeing increased proactive enforcement activity in this area by European data regulators coupled with investigations flowing from complaints made by privacy activist groups. In the United States, several states have enacted laws that regulate the use of consumers&#8217; personal information for marketing purposes. In California, the CCPA gives consumers the right to opt out of the &#8220;sale&#8221; or &#8220;sharing&#8221; or their personal information, where sharing is specifically tied to sharing of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. Similarly, other U.S. states including Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have enacted (or are proposing) similar privacy laws that give consumers the right to opt out of &#8220;targeted advertising,&#8221; with many of these laws also imposing additional requirements for companies who offer opt-outs, including recognizing and honoring opt-out signals. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the trend continues of increasing regulation and enforcement by regulators of the technology we use for marketing, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities. We could also face negative publicity or reputation damage as a result of regulatory action or from being named in complaints or enforcement actions about our practices. Widespread adoption of regulations that significantly restrict our ability to use performance marketing technology could adversely affect our ability to market effectively to current and prospective Hosts and guests, and thus materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented means to make it easier for consumers to prevent the placement of cookies, to block other tracking technologies or to require new permissions from consumers for certain activities, which could, if widely adopted, significantly reduce the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. In light of the complex and evolving nature of laws on cookies and tracking technologies, including in the EU, EU Member State, UK and U.S., there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to comply with such laws; violations of such laws could \n",

We believe that our SEO results have been adversely affected by the launch of Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, which reduce the prominence of our platform in organic search results for travel-related terms and placement on Google. To the extent that our brand and platform are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search results for any reason, we would need to increase our paid marketing spend which would increase our overall customer acquisition costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If Google or Apple uses its own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor its own or other preferred travel service offerings, or impose policies that effectively disallow us to continue our full product offerings in those channels, there could be an adverse effect on our ability to engage with Hosts and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search. \n",

In addition, any negative publicity or public complaints, including those that impede our ability to maintain positive brand awareness through our marketing and consumer communications efforts, could harm our reputation and lead to fewer Hosts and guests using our platform, and attempts to replace this traffic through other channels will require us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures. \n",

Additional compliance requirements may require us to revise or expand our compliance programs, including the procedures we use to monitor international and domestic transactions.

      "We process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis. When Hosts do not fulfill their obligations to guests, there are fictitious listings or fraudulent bookings on our platform, or there are Host account takeovers, we have incurred and will continue to incur losses from claims by Hosts and guests, and these losses may be substantial. Such instances have and can lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings, referred to as a &#8220;chargeback.&#8221; For the year ended December 31, 2023, total chargeback expense was $130 million. The capabilities of criminal fraudsters, combined with individuals&#8217; susceptibility to fraud may cause our Hosts and guests to be subject to ongoing account takeovers and identity fraud issues. While we have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, there is no guarantee that they will be successful and they require continuous improvement and optimization of continually evolving forms of fraud to be effective. Our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes, which have become increasingly common and sophisticated, could be adversely impacted by the adoption of new payment methods, the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms, including mobile and other devices, and our growth in certain regions, including in regions with a history of elevated fraudulent activity. We expect that technically-knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent our anti-fraud systems including through account takeovers and cybersecurity breaches. In addition, the payment card networks have rules around acceptable chargeback ratios. If we are unable to effectively combat fictitious listings and fraudulent bookings on our platform, combat the use of fraudulent or stolen credit cards, or otherwise maintain or lower our current levels of chargebacks, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or be unable to continue to accept card payments because payment card networks have revoked our access to their networks, any of which would materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our payments platform is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, transactions in violation of economic and trade sanctions, corruption and bribery, terrorist financing, fraudulent listings, Host account takeovers, or the facilitation of other illegal activity. Use of our payments platform for illegal or improper uses has subjected us, and may subject us in the future, to claims, lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or requests, which could result in liability and reputational harm for us. We have taken measures to detect and reduce fraud and illegal activities, but these measures need to be continually improved and may add friction to our booking process. These measures may also not be effective against fraud and illegal activities, particularly new and continually evolving forms of circumvention. If these measures do not succeed in reducing fraud, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "Our payments operations are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Our failure to comply with extensive, complex, overlapping, and frequently changing laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Our payments platform is subject to various laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance, including those governing: cross-border and domestic money transmission and funds transfers; stored value and prepaid access; foreign exchange; data privacy, and data security; banking secrecy; payment services (including payment processing and settlement services); consumer protection; economic and trade sanctions; anti-corruption and anti-bribery; and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing. As we expand and localize our international activities, we have and will become increasingly subject to the laws of additional countries or geographies. In addition, because we facilitate bookings on our platform worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating our payments platform outside of the United States often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations. \n",

Through these assessments, we have identified, and may in the future identify, certain gaps or weaknesses in our existing compliance programs, including in our policies, procedures, or internal controls. As a result of findings from these assessments, we have and may in the future take certain actions, such as implementing enhancements to our compliance measures and amending, updating, or revising our policies, procedures, and internal controls, and other operational frameworks, designed to monitor for and ensure compliance with existing and new laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance. Implementing appropriate measures to fully remediate or address findings from assessments of our compliance programs may require us to incur significant costs. \n",

      "Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations, including the ones described in this risk factor, or orders of any governmental authority, including changes to or expansion of their interpretations, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, result in additional compliance and licensure requirements, and increased regulatory scrutiny of our business. In addition, we may be forced to restrict or change our operations or business practices, make product changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. The complexity of global regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions, and have an adverse impact on, or result in the termination of, our relationships with financial institutions and other service providers on whom we rely for payment processing services. Our ability to track and verify transactions to comply with these regulations, including the ones described in this risk factor, require a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and regulations change, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls could result in reputational harm and result in significant penalties and fines from regulators. \n",

Airbnb Payments has also obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent) in various states and territories where such licenses are required. As a licensed money transmitter, Airbnb Payments is subject to obligations and restrictions with respect to the handling and investment of customer funds, record keeping and reporting requirements, bonding requirements, and inspection by state regulatory agencies. In U.S. states and territories in which Airbnb Payments has not obtained a license to operate as a money transmitter (or its equivalent), we may be required to apply for licenses or regulatory approvals, including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or their interpretations. \n",

      "We principally provide our payment services to Hosts and guests in the EEA through Airbnb Payments Luxembourg SA (&#8220;APLux&#8221;), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a payments institution in Luxembourg. EEA laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the EEA, which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage. For example, countries that are EEA members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing European Directives, including PSD2, the E-Money Directive, and the Fourth and Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directives. Further, we provide our payments services to Hosts and guests in the United Kingdom and other geographies outside the United States and the EEA through Airbnb Payments UK Limited (&#8220;APUK&#8221;), our wholly-owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as an electronic money institution (&#8220;EMI&#8221;) in the United Kingdom (which includes requirements under the UK Electronic Money Regulations 2011 and the UK PSR), as well as through our other wholly-owned payments entities. \n",
      "\n",
      "PSD2 and the UK PSR impose new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication (aimed at fraud reduction) that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a payment transaction. The United Kingdom began enforcing requirements with respect to online card payments in 2022, while countries in the EEA began enforcing these requirements in 2021. In many cases, strong customer authentication requires our UK and EEA guests to engage in additional steps to authenticate payment transactions and EEA Hosts to perform authentication upon access to their Airbnb payout account or modification of their payout account information. These additional authentication requirements may make our platform experience for Hosts and guests in the United Kingdom and EEA \n",

Such laws and regulations are complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and have limited and may continue to limit the ability or willingness of Hosts to share their spaces through our platform and expose our users or us to regulatory inquiries, litigation or other disputes and to significant liabilities, including taxes, compliance costs, fines, and criminal or other penalties, which have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.&#8221; \n",

      "In many countries or geographies, it is and may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, electronic money institution, financial institution, or otherwise. In such instances, we partner with local banks and licensed payment processors to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may slow or halt payments to Hosts conducted through local banks and licensed payment processors or otherwise prohibit or impede us from doing business in a jurisdiction. We may be required to apply for various additional licenses, certifications, and regulatory approvals, including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or their interpretations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. \n",

Our payments entities are subject to inspections, examinations, supervision, and regulation by each relevant regulating authority, including, within the United States, by each state in which Airbnb Payments is licensed. We could be subject to significant fines or other enforcement actions if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing economic and trade sanctions, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance and internal controls, risk management, data privacy, data security and data localization, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other laws and requirements, including those imposed on UK EMIs and Luxembourg payments institutions.

      "Consumer Protection \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the U.S. and the countries from which we provide services. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which is empowered to conduct rulemaking and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. We are subject to a number of such federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations, as well as related state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and its implementing Regulation E. Regulation E applies to certain services provided by Airbnb Payments and requires us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer, among other requirements. In addition, the CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, and new model disclosures. \n",
      "\n",
      "We could be subject to fines or other penalties if we are found to have violated the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices or other consumer financial protection laws enforced by the CFPB or other agencies. The CFPB&#8217;s authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties, including plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys&#8217; fees. The Dodd-Frank Act also empowers state attorneys general and other state officials to enforce federal consumer protection laws under specified conditions. Various government offices and agencies, including various state agencies and state attorneys general (as well as the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Justice), have the authority to conduct reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) involving us or our subsidiaries. These examinations, inquiries, and proceedings could result in, among other things, substantial fines, penalties, or changes in business practices that may require us to incur substantial costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "We provide payment services that may be subject to various U.S. state and federal data privacy and data security laws and regulations. Relevant federal privacy and security laws include the GLBA, which (along with its implementing regulations) restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Any failure to comply with the GLBA and implementing regulations could result in substantial financial penalties. See our risk factor titled &#8220;If we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to data privacy and data security, we may face potentially significant liability, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and increased regulation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.&#8221; \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to UK and Luxembourg payments-related consumer protection laws that are applicable to our business, regulators in EU member states could notify APUK and APLux of local consumer protection laws that apply to our businesses, and could also seek to persuade the UK and Luxembourg regulators to order APUK or APLux to conduct their activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EU countries. \n",

      "Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world, including the BSA and the UK Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (as amended) (the &#8220;MLRs&#8221;). Among other things, the BSA and MLRs require money services businesses (including money transmitters such as Airbnb Payments) to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records. The BSA and UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2022 and Terrorism Act 2000 prohibit, among other things, our involvement in handling or transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. In connection with and when required by regulatory requirements, we make information available to certain U.S. federal and state, as well as certain foreign, government agencies to assist in the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations. In certain circumstances, we may be required by government agencies to deny transactions that may be related to persons suspected of money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activities, and it is possible that we may inadvertently deny transactions from customers who are making legal money transfers. Regulators in the United States and globally may require us to further revise or expand our compliance programs, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. In the United Kingdom and European Union, the implementation of further anti-money laundering requirements and regulations may make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Penalties for non-compliance with the European Union&#8217;s Anti-Money Laundering Directives could include fines of up to 10% of APLux&#8217;s total annual turnover (revenue). The European Union is currently working on proposals for a new package of pan-EU anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations (&#8220;MLD6&#8221;) which may impose yet stricter compliance standards requiring APLux to enhance its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies, procedures, systems, and controls, although the final measures and implementation date of MLD6 are not yet confirmed. Similar penalties are available to the UK Financial Conduct Authority in relation to APUK pursuant to the MLRs. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to governmental economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations that limit the scope of our offering. Additionally, failure to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations could subject us to liability and negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by governments where we operate, including agencies of the U.S. government (including without limitation regulations administered and enforced by OFAC, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Commerce Department), the Council of the European Union, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation of His Majesty&#8217;s Treasury in the United Kingdom (&#8220;OFSI&#8221;) and the Ministry of Finance and Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier of Luxembourg. These economic and trade sanctions generally prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with certain specified countries, regions, governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated, such as individuals and entities included on OFAC&#8217;s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (&#8220;SDN List&#8221;), subject to EU/UK asset freezes, or other sanctions measures. Any future economic and trade sanctions imposed in jurisdictions where we have significant business could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our ability to track and verify transactions and otherwise to comply with these regulations require a high level of internal controls. We maintain policies and procedures to implement these internal controls, which we periodically assess and update to the extent we identify compliance gaps. We routinely report to OFAC on payments we have rejected or blocked pursuant to OFAC sanctions regulations and on possible violations of those regulations. We have also reported to OFSI on dealings with persons subject to UK sanctions and to the Luxembourg Ministry of Finance on dealings with persons subject to EU sanctions. There is a risk that, despite the internal controls that we have in place, we have engaged in transactions inconsistent with applicable sanctions laws. Any non-compliance with economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations or related investigations could result in claims or actions against us and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As our business continues to grow and regulations change, we may be required to make additional investments in our internal controls or modify our business. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to payment network rules and any material modification of our payment card acceptance privileges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The loss of our credit and debit card acceptance privileges or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain card acceptance privileges would significantly limit our business model since a vast majority of our guests pay using credit or debit cards. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (the &#8220;PCI DSS&#8221;). Under the PCI DSS, we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use, storage, and transmission of card data to help prevent credit card fraud. Compliance with PCI-DSS and implementing related procedures, technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention. Costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology, such as those necessary to achieve compliance with PCI-DSS or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our payment related systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we fail to comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, including the PCI DSS, we would be in breach of our contractual obligations to payment processors and merchant banks. Such failure to comply may damage our relationships with payment card networks, subject us to restrictions, fines, penalties, damages, and civil liability, and could eventually prevent us from processing or accepting payment cards, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that may cause loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations and we or our payment processors might find these changes difficult or even impossible to comply with, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to make their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. If we are unable to comply with the security standards established by banks and the payment card industry, we may be subject to fines, restrictions and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could materially and adversely affect our business. Further, there is no guarantee that, even if we comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, we will be able to maintain our payment card acceptance privileges. We also cannot guarantee that our compliance with network rules or the PCI DSS will prevent illegal or improper use of our payments platform or the theft, loss, or misuse of the credit card data of customers or participants, or a security breach. We are also \n",
      "\n",
      "required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, and other assessments of our compliance with the PCI DSS. If an audit, self-assessment, or other assessment indicates that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time-consuming remediation efforts, and we could lose our payment card acceptance privileges. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are also subject to network operating rules and guidelines promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (&#8220;NACHA&#8221;) relating to payment transactions we process using the Automated Clearing House (&#8220;ACH&#8221;) Network. Similar to the payment networks, NACHA may update its operating rules and guidelines at any time, which can require us to take more costly compliance measures or to develop more complex monitoring systems. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on third-party payment service providers to process payments made by guests and payments made to Hosts on our platform. If these third-party payment service providers become unavailable or we are subject to increased fees, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on a number of third-party payment service providers, including payment card networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways, to link us to payment card and bank clearing networks to process payments made by our guests and to remit payments to Hosts on our platform. We have agreements with these providers, some of whom are the sole providers of their particular service. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted, we would need to find an alternate payment service provider, and we may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment service provider in an acceptable time frame. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by our Hosts and guests. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant losses and, in certain cases, require us to make payments to Hosts out of our funds, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the software and services provided by our third-party payment service providers may fail to meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised, or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to Hosts on our platform, or impact our ability to provide regulated payment services. This could make our platform less convenient and desirable to customers and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain Hosts and guests, and result in reputational harm or risk of regulatory investigation or enforcement action. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, our agreements with payment service providers may allow these companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our cash as a reserve. They may be entitled to a reserve or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in our business, results of operations, and financial condition. An imposition of a reserve or suspension of processing services by one or more of our processing companies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we fail to invest adequate resources into the payment processing infrastructure on our platform, or if our investment efforts are unsuccessful or unreliable, our payments activities may not function properly or keep pace with competitive offerings, which could adversely impact their usage. Further, our ability to expand our payments activities into additional countries is dependent upon providers we use to support these activities. As we expand the availability of our payments activities to additional geographies or offer new payment methods to our Hosts and guests in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements, and exposed to heightened fraud risk, which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses. \n",
      "\n",
      "For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, and such fees result in significant costs. Payment card network costs have increased, and may continue to increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks, and may impose special fees or assessments on any such transaction. Our payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us. Credit card transactions result in higher fees to us than transactions made through debit cards. Any material increase in interchange fees in the United States or other geographies, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations imposed by law in some geographies, or other network fees or assessments, or a shift from payment with debit cards to credit cards could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Our failure to properly manage funds held on behalf of customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We offer integrated payments in over 40 currencies to allow access to guest demand from more than 220 countries and regions and the ability for many Hosts to be paid in their local currency or payment method of choice. When a guest books and pays for a stay or experience on our platform, we hold the total amount the guest has paid until check-in, at which time we recognize our service fee as revenue and initiate the process to remit the payment to the Host, which generally occurs 24 hours after the scheduled check-in, barring any alterations or cancellations, which may result in funds being returned to the guest. Accordingly, at any given time, we hold on behalf of our Hosts and guests a substantial amount of funds, which are generally held in bank deposit accounts and in U.S. treasury bills and recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to either safeguard customer funds in bankruptcy-remote bank accounts, or hold such funds in eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in such jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount held on behalf of customers. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the cash underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our offerings, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our platform and services, and result in significant penalties and fines from regulators, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "We recorded the 2026 Notes entirely as a liability on our balance sheet, net of issuance costs. Additionally, the new guidance modifies the treatment of convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash or shares by requiring the use of the &#8220;if-converted&#8221; method. Under that method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the 2026 Notes were converted solely into shares of \n",

In addition, in the future, we may, in our sole discretion, irrevocably elect to settle the conversion value of the 2026 Notes in cash up to the principal amount being converted. Following such an irrevocable election, if the conversion value of the 2026 Notes exceeds their principal amount for a reporting period, then we will calculate our diluted earnings per share by assuming that all of the 2026 Notes were converted at the beginning of the reporting period and that we issued shares of our Class A common stock to settle the excess, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share. \n",

The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of Class A common stock initially underlying the 2026 Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our Class A common stock upon conversion of the 2026 Notes, or at our election (subject to certain conditions), offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of converted 2026 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap. \n",

In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the 2026 Notes and the indenture governing the 2026 Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable. \n",

      "We have adopted a Live and Work Anywhere policy. The increase in remote working could subject us to certain operational challenges and have adverse tax implications, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, we formally adopted our Live and Work Anywhere policy, which permits the majority of our employees to work remotely. Remote working may subject us to operational challenges and risks. For example, a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event may impact our employees&#8217; ability to work remotely. In addition, members of our workforce who work remotely may not have access to technology that is as robust as that in our offices, which could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to those remote workers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. We may also be exposed to risks associated with the locations of remote workers, including compliance with local laws and regulations or exposure to compromised internet infrastructure. Allowing members of our workforce to work remotely may create intellectual property risk if employees create intellectual property on our behalf while residing in a jurisdiction with unenforced or uncertain intellectual property laws. Further, if employees fail to inform us of changes in their work location, we may be exposed to additional risks without our knowledge. Remote working may also result in consumer, privacy, information technology and cybersecurity, and fraud risks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our transition to full or predominantly remote work environments also presents significant challenges to maintaining compliance with country and state requirements such as employee income tax withholding, the recording of reserves to cover withholding corrections or penalties, remittance and reporting, payroll registration, and workers&#8217; compensation insurance. Additionally, foreign tax authorities may assert that certain of our entities have created permanent establishment in their countries which could result in additional corporate income taxes and employee payroll withholding obligations. Any of these operational challenges or tax implications resulting from our Live and Work Anywhere policy may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management and employees. Our founders and other members of our senior management team, as well as other employees, may terminate their employment with us at any time, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "As we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel we need. Our business requires highly skilled technical, engineering, design, product, data analytics, marketing, business development, and community support personnel, including executive-level employees, who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. Competition for qualified employees and executive-level employees is intense in our industry and jurisdictions where we operate. The loss of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate employees required for the planned expansion of our business would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition and impair our ability to grow. \n",
      "\n",
      "To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our programs or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past. We have a number of current employees, including our founders, who hold equity in our Company. As a result, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate these employees, and the value of their holdings could affect their decisions about whether or not they continue to work for us. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may be adversely affected by declines in our stock price. If we issue significant equity to attract employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional stock-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. \n",

      "The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, consolidation, frequent new offering announcements, introductions, and enhancements, and changing consumer demands and preferences. We have invested heavily in our technology in recent years. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt our platform and services to evolving industry standards and local preferences and to continually innovate and improve the performance, features, and reliability of our platform and services in response to competitive offerings and the evolving demands of Hosts and guests. Our future success will also depend on our ability to adapt to emerging technologies such as tokenization, cryptocurrencies, new authentication technologies, such as biometrics, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, AI, virtual and augmented reality, and cloud technologies. As a result, we intend to continue to spend significant resources maintaining, developing, and enhancing our technologies and platform; however, these efforts may be more costly than expected and may not be successful. For example, we may not make the appropriate investments in new technologies, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, technological innovation often results in unintended consequences such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and other system failures. Any such bug, vulnerability, or failure, especially in connection with a significant technical implementation or change, could result in lost business, harm to our brand or reputation, consumer complaints, and other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another critical component to our future success will be our ability to integrate new or emerging payment methods into our platform to offer alternative payment solutions to consumers. Alternate payment providers such as Alipay, Paytm, and WeChat Pay operate closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both consumers and merchants. In many regions, particularly in Asia where credit cards are not readily available and/or e-commerce is largely carried out through mobile devices, these and other emerging alternate payment methods are the exclusive or preferred means of payment for many consumers. \n",

In addition, we rely on third parties for many aspects of our payments platform, and a significant portion of our community support operations are conducted by third parties at their facilities.

Despite our efforts to use commercially reasonable diligence in the selection and retention of such third-party providers, such efforts may be insufficient or inadequate to prevent or remediate such risks. Some of our third-party providers, including our cloud computing providers and our payment processing partners have been and may be subject to further intrusions, computer viruses, malicious software (such as ransomware), denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, terrorism, or other misconduct, and incidents due to inadvertent error or malfeasance by employees, contractors or other parties. There can be no assurance that our service providers will anticipate or prevent all types of attacks or that any security measures will be effective against all types of cybersecurity threats and risks. Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques that circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove forensic evidence, which means that our third-party providers may be unable to detect, investigate, contain or recover from future attacks or incidents in a timely or effective manner. In addition, the global shift to remote working has increased cybersecurity risks and opportunities for threat actors to engage in social engineering (for example, phishing) and to exploit vulnerabilities in non-corporate networks. Our service providers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events, and they may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, each of which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf. In addition, these third parties may breach their agreements with us, disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations, refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, fail to or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately, take actions that degrade the functionality of our platform and services, increase prices, impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers, or give \n",

We also rely on such banks and financial institutions to help process payments transactions. We have both significant funds flows from and to various financial institutions as a result of our processing of payments from guests to Hosts. As part of our currency hedging activities on these balances, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and manage this exposure in an attempt to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition, or service interruptions at, or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets may be limited by the counterparty&#8217;s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, our ability to process payment transactions via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses and be required to make payments to Hosts and/or refunds to guests out of our own funds, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

In addition, we may finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could result in further dilution to our existing stockholders. We may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs.

Open sourcing our own software requires us to make the source code publicly available, and therefore can limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to that software.

Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. \n",

      "Inadvertent use of open source software can occur in software development in the Internet and technology industries. Such inadvertent use of open source software could expose us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of the underlying licenses, which could lead to unforeseen business disruptions, including being restricted from offering parts of our product which incorporate the software, being required to publicly release proprietary source code, being required to re-engineer parts of our code base to comply with license terms, or being required to extract the open source software at issue. Our exposure to these risks may be increased as a result of evolving our core source code base, introducing new offerings, integrating acquired-company technologies, or making other business changes, including in areas where we do not currently compete. Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the value or enforceability of our intellectual property, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Our equity investments in private companies where we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the measurement alternative. Such investments are carried at cost, less any impairments, and are adjusted for subsequent observable price changes, with such changes in value recognized in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, for our equity investments in private companies where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, we record our proportionate share of net income or loss in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. The financial statements provided by these companies are often unaudited. Our investments in private companies are inherently risky and can include investments in early-stage companies with limited cash to support their operations and companies whose results are negatively impacted by downturns in the travel industry. The companies in which we invest include early-stage companies that may still be developing products and services with limited cash to support the development, marketing, and sales of their products. Further, our ability to liquidate such investments is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition, as no public market currently exists for the securities held in the investees. Valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of a liquid market for the securities of such companies. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we will recognize an expense to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value. Negative changes in the estimated fair value of private companies in which we invest could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

Stock prices of many companies, including travel companies and technology companies, have fluctuated in a manner often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies.

Because of the 20-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively continue to control a significant percentage of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until all such outstanding shares of Class B common stock have converted into shares of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, our founders, who collectively hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, are party to a Voting Agreement under which each founder and his affiliates and certain other entities agree to vote their shares for the election of each individual founder to our board of directors. We and each of our founders are party to a Nominating Agreement under which we and the founders are required to take certain actions to include the founders in the slate of nominees nominated by our board of directors for the applicable class of directors, include them in our proxy statement, and solicit proxies or consents in favor of electing each founder to our board of directors. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that stockholders may believe are in their best interest. \n",

      "Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes or transfers among our founders, if all of our founders agree to such transfers. Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Class B holder into one share of Class A common stock. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result, it is possible that one or more of the persons or entities holding our Class B common stock could gain significant voting control as other holders of Class B common stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into Class A common stock. In addition, the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. In addition, any future issuances of common stock would be dilutive to holders of Class A common stock. For example, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. Further, each outstanding share of Class H common stock will convert into a share of Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis upon the sale of such share of Class H common stock to any person or entity that is not our subsidiary, which would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. \n",

Nonetheless, the multi-series structure of our common stock could make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices may not invest in our Class A common stock. It is unclear what effect, if any, such policies and restrictions could have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Because of the multi-class structure of our common stock, we may be excluded from certain indices and we cannot assure that other stock indices will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into \n",

Any registration statement we file to register additional shares, whether as a result of registration rights or otherwise, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline or be volatile. Moreover, new investors in subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) and other equity awards will continue to be a significant expense in future periods. In addition, in the first quarter of 2022, we began using corporate cash to make required tax withholding payments associated with the vesting of employee RSUs and withhold a corresponding number of shares from employees.

We may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, or otherwise.

Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The manner, timing and amount of any share repurchases may fluctuate and will be determined by us based on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, our priorities for the use of cash to support our business operations and plans, general business and market conditions, tax laws, and alternative investment opportunities, all of which may be further impacted by macroeconomic conditions and factors, including rising interest rates, and inflation, global conflicts, and public health crises. Our share repurchase program authorizations do not have an expiration date nor do they obligate us to acquire any specific number or dollar value of shares. Our share repurchase programs may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our Class A common stock. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a 1% excise tax on share repurchases, which would increase the costs associated with repurchasing shares of our common stock. Even if our share repurchase programs are fully implemented, they may not enhance long-term stockholder value or may not prove to be the best use of our cash.

In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, the holders of our Class B common stock, including our founders who are parties to a Nominating Agreement and a Voting Agreement, may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions.

      "Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for an exclusive forum in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, and that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act, which could limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees. \n",

      "Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide, that: (i) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware) will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (b) any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent, or stockholder to the Company or our stockholders, including without limitation a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (c) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any of our current or former director, officer, employee, agent, or stockholder arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (d) any action asserting a claim related to or involving the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; (ii) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (iii) any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions; and (iv) failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause us irreparable harm, and we will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions.

      "Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), from bringing such claims in federal court to the extent that the Exchange Act confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable law. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act. \n",

      "The choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees, agents, or stockholders of the Company, which may discourage such claims against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees, agents, or stockholder of the Company and result in increased costs for investors to bring a claim. \n",

      "General Risk Factors \n",
      "\n",
      "The value of our marketable securities could decline, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our marketable securities portfolio includes various holdings, types, and maturities. Market values of these investments can be adversely impacted by various factors, including liquidity in the underlying security, credit deterioration, the financial condition of the credit issuer, foreign exchange rates, and changes in interest rates. Our marketable securities, which we consider highly-liquid investments, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&#8217; equity (deficit). Realized gains and losses and other than-temporary impairments are reported within other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. Our marketable equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized within other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the fair value of our marketable equity securities declines, our earnings will be reduced or losses will be increased. Furthermore, our interest income from cash, cash equivalents, and our marketable securities are impacted by changes in interest rates, and a decline in interest rates would adversely impact our interest income. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to rules and regulations established by the SEC and Nasdaq regarding our internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete needed improvements to our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our Company and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock and your investment. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established by the SEC and Nasdaq. These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel, including senior management. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In support of such certifications, we were required to document and make significant changes and enhancements, including hiring additional personnel, to our internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm provided an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We anticipate that we will continue investing significant resources to enhance and maintain our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems, and procedures. \n",
      "\n",
      "If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we identify or fail to remediate material weaknesses in our internal controls, or we do not effectively or accurately report our financial performance to the appropriate regulators on a timely basis, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of investor confidence, which could significantly harm our reputation and our stock price, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We face possible risks associated with natural disasters and extreme weather events (the frequency and severity of which may be impacted by climate change), which may include more frequent or severe storms, extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, hurricanes, flooding, rising sea levels, shortages of water, droughts, and wildfires, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which may include more frequent or severe storms, extreme weather events, extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, hurricanes, flooding, rising sea levels, shortages of water, droughts, and wildfires (although it is currently impossible to accurately predict the impact of climate change on the frequency or severity of these events), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We, including through our Hosts, operate in certain areas where the risk of natural or climate-related disaster or other catastrophic losses exists, and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us, our Hosts&#8217; property or the surrounding area. For example, to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns or an increase in extreme weather events, our coastal destinations could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels causing damage to our Hosts&#8217; properties and \n",
      "\n",
      "result in a reduced number of listings in these areas. Other destinations could experience extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, shortages of water, droughts, wildfires, and other extreme weather events that make those destinations less desirable or otherwise reduce the desirability of travel. Climate change may also affect our business by increasing the cost of, or making unavailable, property insurance on terms our Hosts find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs for our Hosts, including the availability and cost of water or energy, and requiring our Hosts to expend funds as they seek to repair and protect their properties in connection with such events. As a result of the foregoing and other climate-related issues, our Hosts may decide to remove their listings from our platform. If we are unable to provide listings in certain areas due to climate change, we may lose both Hosts and guests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The failure to successfully implement and maintain accounting systems could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We occasionally implement, modify, retire and change our accounting systems. For example, we implemented a new cloud-based enterprise resource planning system in 2023. Such transformations involve risk inherent in the conversion to a new system, including loss of information and potential disruption to normal operations. These changes to our information technology systems may be disruptive, take longer than desired, be more expensive than anticipated, be distracting to management, or fail, causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, if our revenue and other accounting or tax systems do not operate as intended or do not scale with anticipated growth in our business, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected. Any failure to develop, implement, or maintain effective internal controls related to our revenue and other accounting or tax systems and associated reporting could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, if we experience interruptions in service or operational difficulties with our revenue and other accounting or tax systems, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "We may raise additional capital in the future or otherwise issue equity, which could have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If we require additional funding to support our business, this additional funding may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "We may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock. As a result, our stockholders may experience immediate dilution. We may engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, our stockholders will experience additional dilution when option holders exercise their right to purchase common stock under our equity incentive plans, when RSUs vest and settle, when we issue equity awards to our employees under our equity incentive plans, or when we otherwise issue additional equity. Additionally, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "There has been increased volatility in the financial and securities markets, which has generally made access to capital less certain and increased the cost of obtaining new capital. Should we require additional funding, we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our ability to continue to support our business and to respond to business challenges would be significantly limited, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in accounting principles. \n",
      "\n",
      "The accounting for our business is subject to change based on the evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting and financial reporting requirements of the SEC or other regulatory agencies. Adoption of a change in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the adoption of such change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles and accounting policies over financial reporting, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could require significant investment in systems and personnel. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#160; \n",
      "\n",
      "Avoiding regulation under the Investment Company Act may adversely affect our operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which &#8220;investment companies&#8221; are permitted to conduct their business activities. We currently conduct, and intend to continue to conduct, our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We are not engaged primarily, nor do we hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and neither do we intend to own investment securities with a combined value in excess of 40% of the value, as determined by our board of directors, of our total assets, exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items, on an unconsolidated basis. We do, however, make minority investments in companies and acquire other financial instruments from time to time that may be deemed investment securities. We expect to conduct our operations such that the value of those investments will not rise to a level where we might be deemed an investment company, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining the required ratios without taking actions that may adversely affect our operations. For example, to avoid being deemed an investment company we may be required to sell certain of our assets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "\n",
      "Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our Class A common stock. The following material factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors, and oral statements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Risks Related to Our Business \n",
      "\n",
      "Our revenue growth rate has slowed over time, and we expect it to continue to slow in the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have experienced significant revenue growth in the past; however, our revenue growth rate has slowed over time and there is no assurance that historic growth rates will return. Our future revenue growth depends on the growth of supply and demand for listings on our platform, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide as well as trends in the global travel and hospitality industries and the short and long-term accommodation regulatory landscape. In addition, we believe that our revenue growth depends upon a number of factors, including: \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates and recessionary concerns; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; our ability to retain and grow the number of guests and Nights and Experiences Booked; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; our ability to retain and grow the number of Hosts and the number of available listings on our platform; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; events beyond our control such as pandemics and other health concerns, restrictions on travel and immigration, political, social or economic instability, including international disputes, war, or terrorism, trade disputes, economic downturns, and the impact of climate change on travel including the availability of preferred destinations and the increase in the frequency and severity of weather-related events, including fires, floods, droughts, extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, severe weather, and other natural disasters, and the impact of other climate change on seasonal destinations; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; competition; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; the legal and regulatory landscape and changes in the application of existing laws and regulations or adoption of new laws and regulations that impact our business, Hosts, and/or guests, including changes in short-term occupancy, tax laws, and real estate broker laws; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; the attractiveness of home sharing to prospective Hosts and guests; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; the level of consumer awareness and perception of our brand; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; our ability to build and strengthen trust and safety on our platform and among members of our community; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; the level of spending on brand and performance marketing to attract Hosts and guests to our platform; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; our ability to grow new offerings and tiers and to deepen our presence in certain geographies; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades to our platform and infrastructure; \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic or epidemic and its impact on the travel and accommodations industries; and \n",
      "\n",
      "&#8226; other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n",
      "\n",
      "A softening of demand, whether caused by events outside of our control, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, challenging macroeconomic conditions, changes in Host and guest preferences, any of the other factors described above, or in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or otherwise, may result in decreased revenue and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we fail to retain existing Hosts or add new Hosts, or if Hosts fail to provide high-quality stays and experiences, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business depends on Hosts maintaining their listings on our platform and engaging in practices that encourage guests to book those listings, including increasing the number of nights and experiences that are available to book, providing timely responses to inquiries from guests, offering a variety of desirable and differentiated listings at competitive prices that meet the expectations of guests, and offering exceptional hospitality, services, and experiences to guests. These practices are outside of our direct control. If Hosts do not establish or maintain a sufficient number of listings and availability for listings, the number of Nights and Experiences Booked declines for a particular period, or the price charged by Hosts declines, our revenue would decline and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hosts manage and control their spaces and experiences and typically market them on our platform with no obligation to make them available to guests for specified dates and with no obligation to accept bookings from prospective guests. We have had many Hosts list their properties on our platform in one period and cease to offer these properties in subsequent periods for a variety of reasons. While we plan to continue to invest in our Host community and in tools to assist Hosts, these investments may not be successful in growing our Hosts and listings on our platform. In addition, Hosts may not establish or maintain listings if we cannot attract prospective guests to our platform and generate bookings from a large number of guests. If we are unable to retain existing Hosts or add new Hosts, or if Hosts elect to market their listings exclusively with a competitor or cross-list with a competitor, we may be unable to offer a sufficient supply and variety of properties or experiences to attract guests to use our platform. In particular, it is critical that we continue to attract and retain individual Hosts who list their spaces, including private rooms, primary homes, or vacation homes, on Airbnb. We attract individual Hosts predominantly through organic channels such as word of mouth and our strong brand recognition. If we are unable to attract and retain individual Hosts in a cost-effective manner, or at all, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Professional Hosts, including property management companies, serviced apartment providers, and boutique hotels, expand the types of listings available to our guests. These professional Hosts often list on our platform as well as on the platforms of our competitors. We do not \n",
      "\n",
      "control whether professional Hosts provide us with a sizable allocation of rooms and competitive pricing relative to the same properties listed with other services. If we are not able to effectively deploy professional tools, application programming interfaces, and payment processes, work with third-party channel managers, and develop effective sales and account management teams that address the needs of these professional Hosts, we may not be able to attract and retain professional Hosts. If our fee structure and payment terms are not as competitive as those of our competitors, these professional Hosts may choose to provide less inventory and availability with us. Historically, we have seen an increase in the number of, and revenue from, professional Hosts on our platform. The uniqueness of listings on our platform will be negatively impacted if the number of individual Hosts does not grow at the same rate. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the number of listings on Airbnb may decline as a result of a number of other factors affecting Hosts, including: the COVID-19 pandemic; enforcement or threatened enforcement of laws and regulations, including short-term occupancy and tax laws; private groups, such as homeowners, landlords, and condominium and neighborhood associations, adopting and enforcing contracts that prohibit or restrict home sharing; leases, mortgages, and other agreements, or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict home sharing; Hosts opting for long-term rentals on other third-party platforms as an alternative to listing on our platform; economic, social, and political factors; perceptions of trust and safety on and off our platform; negative experiences with guests, including guests who damage Host property, throw unauthorized parties, or engage in violent and unlawful acts; and our decision to remove Hosts from our platform for not adhering to our Host standards or other factors we deem detrimental to our community. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that our Host protection programs, including those provided through AirCover for Hosts, are integral to retaining and acquiring Hosts. AirCover for Hosts includes but is not limited to our Host Damage Protection program, which protects Hosts against guest property damage of up to $3 million, and our Host Liability Insurance and Experiences Liability Insurance, which provide liability insurance of up to $1 million, to protect our Hosts against qualifying third-party claims for personal injury or property damage. If we discontinue these programs or these programs prove less effective, whether because our payouts under these programs or our insurance premiums become cost prohibitive or for any other reason, then the number of Hosts who list with us may decline. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, higher than normal payments via refunds and travel credit issuance to guests who cancel for reasons related to COVID-19. Hosts and guests whose reservations are canceled under our extenuating circumstances policy, including for reasons related to COVID-19, have had and may continue to have a negative view of such policy and may experience negative financial impacts as a result of such cancellations. This could materially negatively impact our relationship with our Hosts and guests, resulting in Hosts leaving our platform, removing their listings, and/or offering less availability, or fewer repeat guests, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

The outbreak of COVID-19 and emergence of its variants caused many governments to implement quarantines and significant restrictions on travel or to advise that people remain at home where possible and avoid crowds, which has had a particularly negative impact on cross-border travel. Other events beyond our control, such as unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, tsunamis, floods, severe weather, droughts, extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, and volcanic eruptions, the frequency and severity of which may be increasingly impacted by climate change in future years (although it is currently impossible to predict with accuracy the scale of such \n",

      "impact), and travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Ebola, Zika, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, restrictions related to travel including COVID-19 related vaccination requirements, trade or immigration policies, wars, such as the ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist attacks, sources of political uncertainty, political unrest, protests, violence in connection with political or social events, foreign policy changes, regional hostilities, flight capacity restrictions, immigration restrictions (including backlogs on passport renewals or limitations on visa grants), imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, changes in regulations, policies, or conditions related to sustainability, including climate change and climate-related migration, work stoppages, labor unrest, or travel-related accidents can disrupt travel globally or otherwise result in declines in travel demand. Because many of these events or concerns, and the full impact of their effects, are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our platform and services, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, increasing awareness of the impact of air travel on climate change and the impact of over-tourism may adversely impact the travel and hospitality industries and demand for our platform and services, whether due to the imposition of policies and regulations or changing societal attitudes towards travel. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including adverse economic conditions, are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Our financial performance is subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, worldwide or regional recession, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, fluctuations in exchange rates, inflation, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, tariffs, and other macroeconomic factors. Additional adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, high unemployment, and currency fluctuations can adversely affect consumer confidence in spending and materially adversely affect the demand for travel or similar experiences. Additionally, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy shortages or cost increases, labor and healthcare costs, and other economic factors. These factors may affect demand for our offerings, and uncertainty about global or regional economic conditions can also have a negative adverse impact on the number of Hosts and guests who use our platform. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected, which could lead to a decline in the bookings and prices for stays and experiences on our platform and an increase in cancellations, and thus result in lower revenue. Leisure travel in particular, which accounts for a substantial majority of our current business, is dependent on discretionary consumer spending levels. Downturns in worldwide or regional economic conditions have led to a general decrease in leisure travel and travel spending in the past, and similar downturns in the future may materially adversely impact demand for our platform and services. Such a shift in consumer behavior would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Government regulations in response to the pandemic and changes in social behaviors have closed or limited certain government functions, businesses, or have otherwise limited social or public gatherings. Such mitigation measures that have impacted our business include travel restrictions or quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. These responses, which continue to shift as variants or outbreaks of COVID-19 continue to develop, have had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business and operations and on travel behavior and demand. \n",

      "The extent of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic or epidemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments globally and within the United States, the prevalence of local, national, and international travel restrictions (including new or reinstated restrictions as a result of COVID-19 variants or other highly infectious diseases), vaccination requirements in connection with travel, and impacts and fluctuations in demand for travel, including air travel or gas prices. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in these &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The global travel industry has experienced significant consolidation, and we expect this trend may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in a highly competitive industry. Consolidation amongst our competitors will give them increased scale and may enhance their capacity, abilities, and resources, and lower their cost structures.

Some of our Hosts have chosen to cross-list their properties, which reduces the availability of such properties on our platform. When properties are cross-listed, the price paid by guests on our platform may be or may appear to be less competitive for a number of reasons, including differences in fee structure and policies, which may cause guests to book through other services, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

How Google presents travel search results, and its promotion of its own travel meta-search services, such as Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, or similar actions from other search engines, and their practices concerning search rankings, could decrease our search traffic, increase traffic acquisition costs, and/or disintermediate our platform. These parties can also offer their own comprehensive travel planning and booking tools, or refer leads directly to suppliers, other favored partners, or themselves, which could also disintermediate our platform. In addition, if Google or Apple use their own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor their own or other preferred travel service offerings, or impose policies that effectively disallow us to continue our full product offerings in those channels, it could materially adversely affect our ability to engage with Hosts and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search. \n",

      "\n",
      "Since we began our operations in 2008, there have been and continue to be legal and regulatory developments that affect the short-term rental, long-term rental, and home sharing business. Hotels and groups affiliated with hotels have engaged and will likely continue to engage in various lobbying and political efforts for stricter regulations governing our business in both local and national jurisdictions. Other private groups, such as homeowners, landlords, and condominium and neighborhood associations, have adopted contracts or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict short-term rentals, and third-party lease agreements between landlords and tenants, home insurance policies, and mortgages may prevent or restrict the ability of Hosts to list their spaces. These groups and others cite concerns around affordable housing and over-tourism in major cities among other issues, and some state and local governments have implemented or considered implementing rules, ordinances, or regulations governing the short-term or long-term rental of properties and/or home sharing. For example, in December 2021, the European Commission closed a consultation in relation to a potential EU Short Term Rental Instrument which, if enacted, could have a material impact on the way short-term rentals are regulated in the European Union and the obligations on platforms (including around data sharing or the need to enforce registration schemes). In response, in November 2022, the European Commission proposed a regulation intended to enhance and harmonize transparency, registration, and reporting requirements for short term rental platforms. Specific obligations include steps to enhance the transparency of certain host information on the platform (such as host registration numbers where required locally) and reporting by the platform to local authorities (including, for example, Host information, length of stay, and number of guests). If enacted, this regulation could have a material impact on the way short-term rentals are regulated in the European Union and would require additional resources to assess our compliance and make appropriate adjustments in order to comply with its requirements. This regulation is intended to complement the DSA (defined below), such that relevant platforms, including ours, will be subject to both of these pieces of legislation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Legislation in other regions also could have a material impact on the way short-term and long-term rentals are regulated. Such regulations include ordinances that restrict or ban Hosts from short-term rentals or long-term rentals, set annual caps on the number of days Hosts can share their homes, require Hosts to register with the municipality or city, or require Hosts to obtain permission before offering short-term rentals, or impose obligations on us to assist in the enforcement of these regulations. For example, in New York City a law enacted in 2022 limits the properties that can host short-term rentals. It also contains several new obligations for short-term rental hosts and platforms. In addition, some jurisdictions regard short-term rental or home sharing as &#8220;hotel use&#8221; and claim that such use constitutes a conversion of a residential property to a commercial property. In November 2022, the Digital Services Act (the &#8220;DSA&#8221;) came into force. The majority of the substantive provisions of the DSA will begin to take effect between 2023 and 2024. The DSA will govern, among other things, potential liability for illegal content on platforms, the traceability of traders, and transparency reporting obligations, including information on &#8220;monthly active recipients&#8221; in the European Union. The DSA may increase our compliance costs and require additional resources as well as changes to our processes and operations. Macroeconomic pressures and public policy concerns could continue to lead to new laws and regulations, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or widespread enforcement actions that limit the ability of Hosts to share their spaces. If laws, regulations, rules, or agreements significantly restrict or discourage Hosts in certain jurisdictions from sharing their properties, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "While a number of cities and countries have implemented legislation to address short-term rentals, there are many others that are not yet explicitly addressing or enforcing short-term rental or long-term rental laws, and could follow suit and enact regulations with direct requirements on platforms such as Airbnb. New laws, regulations, government policies, or changes in their interpretations in the over 100,000 cities and towns where we operate entail significant challenges and uncertainties. In the event of any such changes, pre-existing bookings may not be honored and current and future listings and bookings could decline significantly, and our relationship with our Hosts and guests could be negatively impacted, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, if new regulations requiring us to share Host data with such governmental organizations or to ensure that Hosts have a registration or permit number before publishing their listings or some other form of regulation are implemented, our revenue from listings there may be substantially reduced due to the departure from our platform of Hosts who do not wish to share their data or to obtain a registration or permit number. A reduction in supply and cancellations could make our platform less attractive to guests, and any reduction in the number of guests could further reduce the number of Hosts on our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we seek to work with governments, we have in the past been, and are likely in the future to become, involved in disputes with government agencies regarding such laws and regulations. For example, some governments have attempted to impose fines on us regarding what they contend is illegal offering of short-term accommodations in violation of applicable laws. Certain jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations that seek to impose various types of taxes, including lodging taxes, often known as transient or occupancy taxes, on our guests, collection and remittance obligations on our Hosts and/or us, and withholding obligations on us, as more fully described in our risk factor titled &#8220;&#8212; Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our Hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage Hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform.&#8221; In addition, some third parties and regulators have asserted and may in the future assert that we, through our operations, are subject to regulations with respect to short-term rentals, Host registration, licensing, and other requirements for the listing of accommodations and experiences, such as real estate broker or agent \n",
      "\n",
      "licenses, travel agency licenses, e-commerce platform operator, and insurance-related licenses. We could be held liable and incur significant financial and potential criminal penalties if we are found to have violated any of these regulations. In certain jurisdictions, we have resolved disputes concerning the application of these laws and regulations by agreeing, among other things, to remove listings from our platform at the request of government entities, to require Hosts to enter a permit or registration number or take other action before publishing listings on our platform, to share certain data with government agencies to assist in the enforcement of limits on short-term or long-term rentals as well as the enforcement of safety regulations, and to implement measures to confirm to the government that Hosts are operating in compliance with applicable law. When a government agency seeks to apply laws and regulations in a manner that limits or curtails Hosts&#8217; or guests&#8217; ability or willingness to list and search for accommodations in that particular geography, we have attempted and may continue to attempt through litigation or other means to defend against such application of laws and regulations, but have sometimes been and may continue to be unsuccessful in certain of those efforts. Further, if we or our Hosts and guests were required to comply with laws and regulations, government requests, or agreements with government agencies that adversely impact our relations with Hosts and guests, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. Moreover, if we enter an agreement with a government or governmental agency to resolve a dispute, the terms of such agreement may be publicly available and could create a precedent that may lead to similar disputes in other jurisdictions and may put us in a weaker bargaining position in future disputes with other governments. \n",

Moreover, the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate are distinct and may result in inconsistent or ambiguous interpretations among local, regional, or national laws or regulations applicable to our business. Compliance with laws and regulations of different jurisdictions imposing varying standards and requirements is burdensome for businesses like ours, imposes added cost and increases potential liability to our business, and makes it difficult to realize business efficiencies and economies of scale. For example, we incur significant operational costs to comply with requirements of jurisdictions and cities that have disparate requirements around tax collection, tax reporting, Host registration, limits on lengths of stays, and other regulations, each of which require us to dedicate significant resources to provide the infrastructure and tools needed on our platform for our Hosts to meet these legal requirements and for us to fulfill any obligations we may have. The complexity of our platform and changes required to comply with the large number of disparate requirements can lead to compliance gaps if our internal resources cannot keep up with the pace of regulatory change and new requirements imposed on our platform, or if our platform does not work as intended or has errors or bugs. Environmental, health, and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs, and our Hosts&#8217; costs, to comply with such requirements may increase as a result. New or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect the operation of our Hosts&#8217; properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us. \n",
      "\n",
      "It may be difficult or impossible for us to investigate or evaluate laws or regulations in all cities, countries, and regions. The application of existing laws and regulations to our business and platform can be unclear and may be difficult for Hosts, guests, and us to understand and apply, and are subject to change, as governments or government agencies seek to apply legacy systems of laws or adopt new laws to new online business models in the travel and accommodations industries, including ours. Uncertain and unclear application of such laws and regulations to Host and guest activity and our platform could cause and has caused some Hosts and guests to leave or choose not to use our platform, reduce supply and demand for our platform and services, increase the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, and increase the threat of litigation or enforcement actions related to our platform, all of which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See also our risk factor titled &#8220;&#8212; We could face liability for information or content on or accessible through our platform.&#8221; \n",
      "\n",
      "There are laws that apply to us, and there are laws that apply to our Hosts and/or guests. While we require our Hosts and guests to comply with their own independent legal obligations under our terms of service, we have limited means of enforcing or ensuring the compliance of our Hosts and guests with all applicable legal requirements. Sometimes governments try to hold us responsible for laws that apply to our Hosts and/or guests. Whether applicable to us, our Hosts, and/or our guests, the related consequences arising out of such laws and regulations, including penalties for violations of and costs to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We take certain measures to comply, and to help Hosts comply, with laws and regulations, such as requiring registration numbers to be displayed on a listing profile for listings in some jurisdictions where such registration is required. These measures, changes to them, and any future measures we adopt could increase friction on our platform, and reduce the number of listings available on our platform from Hosts and bookings by guests, and could reduce the activity of Hosts and guests on our platform. We may be subject to additional laws and regulations which could require significant changes to our platform that discourage Hosts and guests from using our platform. Our newer offerings, such as Airbnb Experiences, are subject to similar or other laws, regulations, and regulatory actions. In particular, if we become more involved in Hosts&#8217; listings and conduct related to bookings, then we are more likely to draw scrutiny and additional regulations from governments and undercut various defenses we may have to claims or attempts to regulate us, which further constrain our business and impose additional liability on us as a platform. \n",

      "As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions have adopted and may continue to adopt or modify laws, rules, regulations, and/or decrees intended to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including implementing travel restrictions, such as vaccination requirements for travel to and/or from certain regions. In addition, many jurisdictions have limited social mobility and gatherings. As the COVID-19 pandemic or related restrictions continue, governments, corporations, and other authorities may continue to implement restrictions or policies that could further restrict the ability of our Hosts and guests to participate on our platform. \n",

      "There is increased governmental interest in regulating technology companies in areas including platform content, data privacy, data security, intellectual property protection, ethical marketing, tax, data localization and data access, artificial intelligence or algorithm-based bias or discrimination, competition, and real estate broker related activities. In addition, increasing governmental interest in, and public awareness of, the impacts and effects of climate change and greater emphasis on sustainability by federal, state, and international governments could lead to further regulatory efforts to address the carbon impact of housing and travel. In particular, the current regulatory landscape regarding climate change (including disclosure requirements and requirements regarding energy and water use and efficiency), both within the United States and in many other locations where we operate worldwide, is evolving at a pace, and is likely to continue to develop in ways, that require our business to adapt. Many U.S. states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address greenhouse gas emissions, including disclosure requirements relating thereto, and some U.S. states have also adopted various environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;)-related efforts, initiatives and requirements. As a result, governments may enact new laws and regulations and/or view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past, including laws and regulations which are responsive to ESG trends or otherwise seek to reduce the carbon emissions relating to travel and set minimum energy efficiency requirements, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In particular, stricter regulation in relation to energy and water use and efficiency requirements could lead to a reduced number of listings in affected jurisdictions. The legislative landscape continues to be in a state of constant change as well as legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on our business in the aggregate. We incur significant expenses and commit significant resources so that our platform can comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully implement technical upgrades and other system implementations in a timely manner since implementations often involve building new infrastructure and tools, which contain the inherent risk of unplanned errors and defects, and in certain instances we may be unable to respond to legislation or regulation in a way that fully mitigates any negative impacts our business. \n",

      "Any new or existing laws and regulations applicable to existing or future business areas, including amendments to or repeal of existing laws and regulations, or new interpretations, applications, or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and materially adversely impact bookings on our platform, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, the UK laws and regulations that impact our UK and EU operations, including those relating to payment processing, data privacy and data security, legal protection for platforms, workers&#8217; rights, and intellectual property changed or may change following the United Kingdom&#8217;s departure from the European Union. The Omnibus Directive also introduces stricter penalties for breaches of consumer protection law. This includes an introduction of fines as a mandatory element of penalties in some situations and higher amounts, as well as additional information requirements. The Collective Redress Directive replaced its predecessor in November 2020. This relatively new Directive allows for the recovery of monetary compensation on behalf of large classes of consumers, and greatly extends the scope to new areas, including for example misleading and comparative advertising, data privacy and data security. The European Union is also enhancing the regulation of digital services, and in November 2022, the DSA came into force. The majority of the substantive provisions of the DSA will begin to take effect between 2023 and 2024. The DSA will govern, among other things, potential liability for illegal content on platforms, traceability of traders, and transparency reporting obligations, including information on &#8220;monthly active recipients&#8221; in the European Union. The DSA may increase compliance costs and require additional resources as well as changes to our processes and operations. In parallel, the Digital Markets Act (the &#8220;DMA&#8221;) came into force in November 2022 and introduces ex ante regulation of certain large online platforms. We do not anticipate being designated a regulated gatekeeper platform for the purposes of the DMA although this could change at some point in the future. Some European jurisdictions (such as Germany) have also introduced new competition rules in relation to digital platforms similar to the DMA at the national level. These laws may contain certain regulatory requirements and/or obligations that could negatively impact the business of companies like ours. Furthermore, some of our Hosts or some of our offerings may now or in the future be subject to the European Package Travel Directive, which imposes various obligations upon package providers and upon marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers. Our efforts to influence legislative and regulatory proposals have an uncertain chance of success, could be limited by laws regulating lobbying or advocacy activity in certain jurisdictions, and even if successful, could be expensive and time consuming, and could divert the attention of management from operations. \n",

We are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of such inquiries, investigations, and proceedings on our business, and such inquiries, investigations, and proceedings could result in damages, large fines and penalties, and require changes to our products and operations, and materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. In some instances, applicable laws and regulations do not yet exist or are being adopted and implemented to address certain aspects of our business, and such adoption or change in their interpretation could further alter or impact our business and subject us to future government inquiries, investigations, and proceedings. \n",

      "We have been involved in litigation with national governments, trade associations and industry bodies, municipalities, and other government authorities, including as a plaintiff and as a defendant, concerning laws seeking to limit or outlaw short-term and long-term rentals and to impose obligations or liability on us as a platform. In the United States, we have been involved in various lawsuits concerning whether our platform is responsible for alleged wrongful conduct by Hosts who engage in short-term rentals. Claims in such cases have alleged illegal hotel conversions, real estate license requirements, violations of municipal law around short-term occupancy or rentals, unlawful evictions, or violations of lease provisions or homeowners&#8217; association rules. Legal claims have been asserted for alleged discriminatory conduct undertaken by Hosts against certain guests, and for our own platform policies or business practices. Changes to the interpretation of the applicability of fair housing, civil rights, or other statutes to our business or the conduct of our users could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as U.S. laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&#8220;DMCA&#8221;), the Stored Communications Act, and the Communications Decency Act (&#8220;CDA&#8221;), and non-U.S. laws such as the DSA and the European E-Commerce Directive and its national transpositions are interpreted by the courts or otherwise modified or amended, as our platform and services to our Hosts and guests continue to expand, and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. \n",

      "In addition, we face claims and litigation relating to fatalities, shootings, other violent acts, illness (including COVID-19), cancellations and refunds, personal injuries, property damage, carbon monoxide incidents, hidden camera incidents, and privacy violations that occurred at listings or experiences during a booking made on our platform. We also have had putative class action litigation and government inquiries, and could face additional litigation and government inquiries and fines relating to our business practices, cancellations, and other consequences due to natural disasters or other unforeseen events beyond our control such as wars, regional hostilities, health concerns, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19, or law enforcement demands, and other regulatory actions. \n",

      "Notwithstanding the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (&#8220;CJEU&#8221;) on December 19, 2019 ruling that Airbnb is a provider of information society services under the E-Commerce Directive, there continue to be new laws and government initiatives within the European Union attempting to regulate Airbnb as a platform. In several cases, national courts are evaluating whether certain local rules imposing obligations on platforms can be enforced against us. For example, we are challenging laws in various European jurisdictions requiring short-term rental platforms to act as withholding tax agent for Host income taxes, to collect and remit tourist taxes, and to disclose user data. Adverse rulings in these national cases are possible and could result in changes to our business practices in significant ways, increased operating and compliance costs, and lead to a loss of revenue for us. In addition, the DSA came into force in November 2022, and amends certain aspects of the E-Commerce Directive to enhance the rules that apply to platforms. \n",

We also have indemnification agreements with certain of our directors, executive officers, and certain other employees that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. We may be subject to litigation stemming from these obligations. \n",

Moreover, many regulatory inquiries, litigation, legal proceedings, or claims are resolved by settlements that can include both monetary and nonmonetary components. Adverse results or settlements may result in changes in our business practices in significant ways, increased operating and compliance costs, and a loss of revenue. In addition, any litigation or pre-litigation claims against us, whether or not meritorious, are time consuming, require substantial expense, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. We use various software platforms that in some instances have limited functionality which may impede our ability to fully retrieve records. In addition, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. As we continue to grow, regulatory inquiries, litigation, legal proceedings, and other claims will continue to consume significant company resources and adverse results in future matters could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Additionally, there have been various federal legislative efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under the CDA, and current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. There is proposed U.S. federal legislation seeking to hold platforms liable for user-generated content, including content related to short-term or long-term rentals.

In countries in Asia and Latin America, generally there are not similar statutes as the CDA or E-Commerce Directive. The laws of countries in Asia and Latin America generally provide for direct liability if a platform is involved in creating such content or has actual knowledge of the content without taking action to take it down. Further, laws in some Asian countries also provide for primary or secondary liability, which can include criminal liability, if a platform failed to take sufficient steps to prevent such content from being uploaded. Because liability often flows from information or content on our platform and/or services accessed through our platform, as we continue to expand our offerings, tiers, and scope of business, both in terms of the range of offerings and services and geographical operations, we may face or become subject to additional or different laws and regulations. Our potential liability for information or content created by third parties and posted to our platform could require us to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to such liability, may require us to expend significant resources, may limit the desirability of our platform to Hosts and guests, may cause damage to our brand or reputation, and may cause us to incur time and costs defending such claims in litigation, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

If Consumer Protection Regulators find that we are in breach of consumer protection laws, we may be fined or required to change our terms and processes, which may result in increased operational costs. Consumers and certain Consumer Protection Associations may also bring individual claims against us if they believe that our terms and/or business practices are not in compliance with local consumer protection laws.

In addition, when Hosts cancel reservations or if we fail to provide timely refunds to guests in connection with cancellations, guest perception of the value of our platform is adversely impacted and may cause guests to not use our platform in the future. The impact of these issues may be more pronounced if we are seen to have failed to provide prompt and appropriate community support or our platform policies are perceived to be too permissive, too restrictive, or providing Hosts and/or guests with unsatisfactory resolutions. We have been the subject of media reports, social media posts, blogs, and other forums that contain allegations about our business or activity on our platform that create negative publicity. As a result of these complaints and negative publicity, some Hosts have refrained from, and may in the future refrain from, listing with us, and some guests have refrained from, and may in the future refrain from, using our platform, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Media, legislative, or government scrutiny around our company, including the perceived impact on affordable housing and over-tourism, neighborhood nuisance, privacy practices, provision of information as requested by certain governments or agencies thereof, content on our platform, business practices and strategic plans, impact of travel on the climate and local environment, and public health policies that may cause geopolitical backlash, our business partners, private companies where we have minority investments, and our practices relating to our platform, offerings, employees, competition, litigation, and response to regulatory activity, could adversely affect our brand and our reputation with our Hosts, guests, and communities.

We rely on these reviews to further strengthen trust among members of our community. Our Hosts and guests may be less likely to rely on reviews and ratings if they believe that our review system does not generate trustworthy reviews and ratings. We have procedures in place to combat fraud or abuse of our review system, but we cannot guarantee that these procedures are or will be effective. In addition, if our Hosts and guests do not leave reliable reviews and ratings, other potential Hosts or guests may disregard those reviews and ratings, and our systems that use reviews and ratings to enforce quality standards would be less effective, which could reduce trust within our community and damage our brand and reputation, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

We do not verify the identity of all of our Hosts and guests nor do we verify or screen third parties who may be present during a reservation made through our platform. Our identity verification processes rely on, among other things, information provided by Hosts and guests, and our ability to validate that information and the effectiveness of third-party service providers that support our verification processes may be limited. In addition, we do not currently and may not in the future require users to re-verify their identity following their successful completion of the initial verification process. Certain verification processes, including legacy verification processes on which we previously relied, may be less reliable than others. We screen against certain regulatory, terrorist, and sanctions watch lists, conduct criminal background checks for certain U.S. Hosts, U.S. guests, and Hosts in India, and conduct additional screening processes to flag and investigate suspicious activities. These processes are beneficial but not exhaustive and have limitations due to a variety of factors, including laws and regulations that prohibit or limit our ability to conduct effective background checks in some jurisdictions, the unavailability and inaccuracy of information, and the inability of our systems to detect all suspicious activity. There can be no assurances that these measures will significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on our platform. The criminal background checks for certain U.S. Hosts, U.S. guests, and Hosts in India, and other screening processes rely on, among other things, information provided by Hosts and guests, our ability to validate that information, the accuracy, completeness, and availability of the underlying information relating to criminal records, the digitization of certain records, the evolving regulatory landscape in this area such as in the data privacy and data security space, and on the effectiveness of third-party service providers that may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility, and we do not run criminal background checks and other screening processes on third parties who may be present during a reservation made through our platform. \n",

In addition, we have not in the past taken and may not in the future take steps to re-verify or re-screen Host qualifications, listings, or experiences following initial review. We have in the past relied, and may in the future, rely on Hosts and guests to disclose information relating to their listings and experiences and such information may be inaccurate or incomplete. We have created policies and standards to respond to issues reported with listings, but certain listings may pose heightened safety risks to individual users because those issues have not been reported to us or because our customer support team has not taken the requisite action based on our policies. We rely, at least in part, on reports of issues from Hosts and guests to investigate and enforce many of our policies and standards. In addition, our policies may not contemplate certain safety risks posed by listings or individual Hosts or guests or may not sufficiently address those risks. \n",

While we recognize that we need to continue to build trust and invest in innovations that will support trust when it comes to our policies, tools, and procedures to help protect Hosts, guests, and the communities in which our Hosts operate, we may not be successful in doing so. Similarly, listings that are inaccurate, of a lower than expected quality, or that do not comply with our policies may harm guests and public perception of the quality and safety of listings on our platform and materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Such incidents have prompted, and may in the future prompt, stricter home sharing regulations or regulatory inquiries into our platform policies and business practices. In the United States and other countries, we have seen listings being used for parties in violation of Airbnb&#8217;s policies which have in some cases resulted in neighborhood disruption or violence. Further, claims have been asserted against us from our Hosts, guests, and third parties for compensation due to fatalities, accidents, injuries, assaults, theft, property damage, data privacy and data security issues, fraudulent listings, and other incidents that are caused by other Hosts, guests, or third parties while using our platform. These claims subject us to potentially significant liability and increase our operating costs and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have obtained some third-party insurance, which is subject to certain conditions and exclusions, for claims and losses incurred based on incidents related to bookings on our platform. Our third-party insurance, which may or may not be applicable to all claims, may be inadequate to fully cover alleged claims of liability, investigation costs, defense costs, and/or payouts. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant time and cost investigating and defending against them. As we expand our offerings and tiers, or if the quantity or severity of incidents increases, our insurance rates and our financial exposure will grow, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Measures that we are taking to improve the trust and safety of our platform may cause us to incur significant expenditures and may not be successful. \n",

These measures are long-term investments in our business and the trust and safety of our community. However, some of these measures increase friction on our platform by increasing the number of steps required to list or book, which reduces Host and guest activity on our platform, and could materially adversely affect our business. Implementing the trust and safety initiatives we have announced, which include limited verification of Hosts and listings, restrictions on &#8220;party&#8221; houses, restrictions on certain types of bookings, and our neighbor hotline, or other initiatives, has caused and will continue to cause us to incur significant ongoing expenses and may result in fewer listings and bookings or reduced Host and guest retention, which could also materially adversely affect our business. As we operate a global platform, the timing and implementation of these measures will vary across geographies and may be restricted by local law requirements. We have invested and plan to continue to invest significantly in the trust and safety of our platform, but there can be no assurances that these measures will be successful, significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on or off our platform, or be sufficient to protect our reputation in the event of such activity. \n",

      "Furthermore, we have established community standards, but those standards may not always be effectively enforced, communicated to, or consistently understood by all parts of our community. For example, while we require and communicate to Hosts and guests to make certain commitments with respect to diversity and belonging when they join Airbnb, these standards and requirements are not always well understood by all parts of our community. As a result, Hosts and guests may be surprised or disappointed when their expectations are not met. \n",

      "Growing focus on evolving environmental, social, and governance issues (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) by shareholders, customers, regulators, politicians, employees, and other stakeholders may impose additional risks and costs on our business. \n",

      "ESG matters have become an area of growing and evolving focus among our shareholders and other stakeholders, including among customers, employees, regulators, politicians, and the general public in the United States and abroad.

Notwithstanding our commitments to stakeholders and intentions with respect to other constituencies, if we fail to meet evolving investor, regulator, and other stakeholder expectations on ESG matters, if we are perceived not to have responded appropriately or in a timely manner to ESG issues that are material, or perceived to be material, to our business (including failing to pursue or achieve our stated goals, targets and objectives within the timelines we announce, failing to satisfy reporting and disclosure expectations or requirements, or if there are real or perceived inaccuracies in the data and information we report), if we fail to accurately report ESG-related data, or if we fail to fully understand, reflect, disclose, mitigate or manage risks associated with environmental or social matters, we may experience harm to our brand and reputation, adverse press coverage, a reduction in our attractiveness as an investment, greater regulatory scrutiny and potential legal claims, greater difficulties in attracting and retaining customers and talent, increased costs associated with our legal compliance, insurance, or access to capital, and as a consequence, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or stock price could be materially adversely affected.

      "We believe that maintaining and strengthening our brand is an important aspect of our efforts to attract and retain Hosts and guests. In particular, we rely on marketing to drive guest traffic to our platform. We have invested considerable resources into establishing and maintaining our brand. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we realigned our organizational priorities to further increase our focus on individual Hosts and brand marketing, while reducing performance marketing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our brand marketing efforts include a variety of online and offline marketing distribution channels. Our brand marketing efforts are expensive and may not be cost-effective or successful. If our competitors spend increasingly more on brand marketing efforts, we may not be able to maintain and grow traffic to our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have used performance marketing products offered by search engines and social media platforms to distribute paid advertisements that drive traffic to our platform. The remainder of our traffic comes through direct or unpaid channels, which include brand marketing and search engine optimization (&#8220;SEO&#8221;). A critical factor in attracting Hosts and guests to our platform is how prominently listings are displayed in response to search queries for key search terms. The success of home sharing and our brand has led to increased costs for relevant keywords as our competitors competitively bid on our keywords, including our brand name. Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels. However, we may not be successful at our efforts to drive traffic growth cost-effectively. If we are not able to effectively increase our traffic growth without increases in spend on performance marketing, we may need to increase our performance marketing spend in the future, including in response to increased spend on performance marketing from our competitors, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "The technology that powers much of our performance marketing is increasingly subject to strict regulation, and regulatory or legislative changes could adversely impact the effectiveness of our performance marketing efforts and, as a result, our business. For example, we rely on the placement and use of &#8220;cookies&#8221; &#8212; text files stored on a Host or guest&#8217;s web browser or device &#8212; and related and similar technologies to support tailored marketing to consumers. Many countries have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, regulations governing the use of cookies and similar technologies, and individuals may be required to &#8220;opt-in&#8221; to the placement of cookies used for purposes of marketing. For example, we are subject to evolving EU and UK privacy laws on cookies, tracking technologies, and e-marketing. In the European Union and United Kingdom under national laws derived from the ePrivacy Directive, informed consent is often required for the placement of a cookie or similar technology on a user&#8217;s device and for direct electronic marketing. The GDPR also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. The GDPR and similar laws also strictly regulate our use of personal data for marketing purposes. Additional legislation in this space is anticipated, which may increase the burden on our business and fines for non-compliance. While the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, recent European court and regulatory decisions as well as guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies, in particular in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem. We are seeing increased proactive enforcement activity in this area by European data regulators coupled with investigations flowing from complaints made by privacy activist groups. In the United States, several states have enacted laws that regulate the use of consumers&#8217; personal information for marketing purposes. In California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020) (&#8220;CCPA&#8221; ) gives consumers the right to opt out of the &#8220;sale&#8221; or &#8220; sharing&#8221; or their personal information, where sharing is specifically tied to sharing of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. With respect to the sale or sharing of personal information, the California Attorney General recently signaled an intent to aggressively enforce the CCPA&#8217;s requirements on consumer opt-outs of the sale of personal information. Additionally, laws going into effect in 2023 in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah give consumers the right to opt out of &#8220;targeted advertising.&#8221; \n",
      "\n",
      "If the trend continues of increasing regulation and enforcement by regulators of the technology we use for marketing, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities. We could also face negative publicity or reputation damage as a result of regulatory action or from being named in complaints or enforcement actions about our practices. Widespread adoption of regulations that significantly restrict our ability to use performance marketing technology could adversely affect our ability to market effectively to current and prospective Hosts and guests, and thus materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented means to make it easier for consumers to prevent the placement of cookies, to block other tracking technologies or to require new permissions from consumers for certain activities, which could, if widely adopted, significantly reduce the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. \n",
      "\n",
      "We focus on unpaid channels such as SEO. SEO involves developing our platform in a way that enables a search engine to rank our platform prominently for search queries for which our platform&#8217;s content may be relevant. Changes to search engine algorithms or similar actions are not within our control, and could adversely affect our search-engine rankings and traffic to our platform. We believe that our SEO results have been adversely affected by the launch of Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, which reduce the prominence of our platform in organic search results for travel-related terms and placement on Google. To the extent that our brand and platform are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search results for any reason, we would need to increase our paid marketing spend which would increase our overall customer acquisition costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If Google or Apple uses its own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor its own or other preferred travel service offerings, or impose policies that effectively disallow us to continue our full product offerings in those channels, there could be an adverse effect on our ability to engage with Hosts and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search. \n",

      "Moreover, as guests increase their booking activity across multiple travel sites or compare offerings across sites, our marketing efficiency and effectiveness is adversely impacted, which could cause us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures in the future, which may not be offset by additional revenue, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, any negative publicity or public complaints, including those that impede our ability to maintain positive brand awareness through our marketing and consumer communications efforts, could harm our reputation and lead to fewer Hosts and guests using our platform, and attempts to replace this traffic through other channels will require us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures. \n",

Under that method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the 2026 Notes were converted solely into shares of Class A common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. In addition, in the future, we may, in our sole discretion, irrevocably elect to settle the conversion value of the 2026 Notes in cash up to the principal amount being converted. Following such an irrevocable election, if the conversion value of the 2026 Notes exceeds their principal amount for a reporting period, then we will calculate our diluted earnings per share by assuming that all of the 2026 Notes were converted at the beginning of the reporting period and that we issued shares of our Class A common stock to settle the excess, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, if any of the conditions to the convertibility of the 2026 Notes are satisfied, then, under certain conditions, we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the 2026 Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their 2026 Notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital. \n",

      "\n",
      "In connection with the pricing of the 2026 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain option counterparties. The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of Class A common stock initially underlying the 2026 Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our Class A common stock upon conversion of the 2026 Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments we are required to \n",

      "We have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates purchased shares of our Class A common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the 2026 Notes. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we have been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the 2026 Notes and prior to the maturity of the 2026 Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions and in connection with any early termination event in respect of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock. \n",

      "Certain provisions in the 2026 Notes and the indenture governing the 2026 Notes could make a third-party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes), then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their 2026 Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the 2026 Notes and the indenture governing the 2026 Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable. \n",

Our internal systems and tools are subject to a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations globally. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV metrics are adjusted for cancellations and alterations that happen in the reporting period. However, cancellations and alterations for bookings made in the reporting period can occur beyond the current reporting period. This results in a reported amount of Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV in the quarter of the booking for which all of the bookings may ultimately not result in check-ins, and subsequently reduces our Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV metrics in subsequent quarters when we experience cancellations. Cancellations and alterations to previously booked trips increased dramatically after the COVID-19 outbreak, as guests were either unable to travel or uncomfortable traveling. If we experience high levels of cancellations in the future, our performance and related business metrics will be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "The calculation of Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings requires the ongoing collection of data on new offerings that are added to our platform over time. Our business is complex, and the methodology used to calculate Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings may require future adjustments to accurately represent the full value of new offerings. \n",
      "\n",
      "An active booker is a unique guest who has booked a stay or experience in a given time period. Certain individuals may have more than one guest account and therefore may be counted more than once in our count of active bookers. We count the number of Hosts on our platform based on the number of Hosts with an available listing as of a certain date.

Further, any such fraudulent activity, along with associated refunds and cancellations, would reduce our metrics, in particular Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings, in the quarter in which it is discovered. Limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operational metrics are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive these metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, our stock price could decline, we may be subject to stockholder litigation, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "We need to continue to invest in the development of new offerings and initiatives that differentiate us from our competitors, such as Airbnb Experiences. Developing and delivering these new offerings and initiatives increase our expenses and our organizational complexity, and we may experience difficulties in developing and implementing these new offerings and initiatives. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our new offerings and initiatives have a high degree of risk, as they may involve unproven businesses with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience. There can be no assurance that consumer demand for such offerings and initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, that we will be able to successfully manage the development and delivery of such offerings and initiatives, or that any of these offerings or initiatives will gain sufficient market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset associated expenses or liabilities. It is also possible that offerings developed by others will render our offerings and initiatives noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, these efforts entail investments in our systems and infrastructure, payments platform, and increased legal and regulatory compliance expenses, could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established offerings and geographies. Even if we are successful in developing new offerings and initiatives, regulatory authorities may subject us or our Hosts and guests to new rules, taxes, or restrictions or more aggressively enforce existing rules, taxes, or restrictions, that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully commercializing these initiatives. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, we may fail to grow and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "If we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to data privacy and data security, we may face potentially significant liability, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and increased regulation and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Data privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations are complex, and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, other processing, and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs or have other material adverse effects on our business. As part of Host and guest registration and business processes, we collect and use personal data, such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and identity verification information (for example, government issued identification or passport), as well as credit card or other financial information that Hosts and guests provide to us. The laws of many states and countries require businesses that maintain such personal data to implement reasonable measures to keep such information secure and otherwise restrict the ways in which such information can be collected and used. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, has resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies like ours. The GDPR regulates our collection, control, processing, sharing, disclosure, and other use of data that can directly or indirectly identify a living individual (&#8220;personal data&#8221;), and imposes stringent data protection requirements with significant penalties, and the risk of civil litigation, for noncompliance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. It may also lead to civil litigation, with the risks of damages or injunctive relief, or regulatory orders adversely impacting the ways in which our business can use personal data. Many large geographies in which we operate, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and India, have passed or are in the process of passing comparable or other robust data privacy and security legislation or regulation, which may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, from January 1, 2021 (when the transitional period following Brexit expired), we are also subject to the GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act of 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. Both regimes have the ability to fine up to the greater of 20 million Euros (17 million British Pounds) or 4% of global turnover, respectively. The UK framework may in the future start to diverge from the EU framework, and these changes may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. \n",

      "Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;). Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA and United Kingdom to the United States and other jurisdictions. On July 16, 2020, the CJEU invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (&#8220;Privacy Shield&#8221;) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to US entities that had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it noted that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances; this has created uncertainty and increased the risk around our international operations. Following the CJEU&#8217;s ruling, there has been increased regulatory action in this area and several decisions by EU Data Protection Authorities that transfer to the United States, including transfer to well-known U.S. service providers, are unlawful. As the enforcement landscape further develops, and supervisory authorities issue further decisions and guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used or if our use of certain products and vendors is the subject of investigation, we could suffer additional costs, complaints, or fines, have to stop using certain tools and vendors and make other operational changes, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to other mechanisms (particularly standard contractual clauses), we previously relied on our own Privacy Shield certification and, in limited instances, the Privacy Shield certifications of third parties (for example, vendors and partners) for the purposes of transferring personal data from the EEA and United Kingdom to the United States. We continue to rely on the standard contractual clauses to transfer personal data outside the EEA and United Kingdom, including to the United States. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we rely on derogations provided for by law. These recent developments may require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and/ or receive personal data transfers to the United States and other jurisdictions. As our lead supervisory authority, the European Data Protection Board, and other data protection regulators issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including \n",
      "\n",
      "circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and/or take further or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, have to stop using certain tools and vendors and make operational changes, suffer complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services and our ability to provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, there are numerous federal and state data privacy and security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, use, storage, sharing, transmission, and other processing of personal information, including federal and state data privacy laws, data breach notification laws, and consumer protection laws. One such federal law is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) and its implementing regulations, which restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. The U.S. government, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. In addition, numerous states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and processing of state residents&#8217; personal data. For example, the CCPA took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA established a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours, and may continue to require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. The CCPA provides new and enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording consumers the right to access and delete their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. The CCPA also prohibits covered businesses from discriminating against consumers (for example, charging more for services) for exercising any of their CCPA rights. The CCPA imposes severe statutory damages as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches of specific categories of personal information. This private right of action has increased the risks associated with data breach litigation. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;). The CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA modifies and expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements that may impact our business, and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements. In addition, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut recently passed comprehensive privacy laws that take effect in 2023 and will impose obligations similar to or more stringent than those we may face under other data privacy and security laws. Together, these laws will add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment in resources to compliance programs, could impact strategies and availability of previously useful data, and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Various other governments and consumer agencies around the world have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices and many have enacted different and often contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically. Compliance with numerous and contradictory requirements of different jurisdictions is particularly difficult and costly for an online business such as ours, which collects personal information from Hosts, guests, and other individuals in multiple jurisdictions. If any jurisdiction in which we operate adopts news laws or changes its interpretation of its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or localization such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we could risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources to comply with privacy regulations around the world, many of these regulations expose us to the possibility of material penalties, significant legal liability, changes in how we operate or offer our products, and interruptions or cessation of our ability to operate in key geographies, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, to improve the trust and safety on our platform, we conduct certain verification procedures aimed at our Hosts, guests, and listings in certain jurisdictions. Such verification procedures may include utilizing public information on the Internet, accessing public databases such as court records, utilizing third-party vendors to analyze Host or guest data, or physical inspection. These types of activities may expose us to the risk of regulatory enforcement from privacy regulators, consumer protection agencies, consumer credit reporting agencies, and civil litigation. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from, or give data access to, government agencies, including tax authorities, state and city regulators, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence agencies, our Hosts, guests, and data privacy and security regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with data privacy and data security policies, notices, and laws, which could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions. Conversely, if we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement, such as on the interpretation of the law, we are likely to face enforcement action from such government, engage in litigation, face increased regulatory scrutiny, and experience an adverse impact on our relationship with governments or our ability to offer our services within certain jurisdictions. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business also increasingly relies on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and automated decision making to improve our services and tailor our interactions with our customers. However, in recent years use of these methods has come under increased regulatory scrutiny. New laws, guidance, and/or decisions in this area may limit our ability to use our machine learning and artificial intelligence, or require us to make changes to our platform or operations that may decrease our operational efficiency, result in an increase to operating costs and/or hinder our ability to improve our services. For example, there are specific rules on the use of automated decision making under global privacy laws that require the existence of automated decision making to be disclosed to the data subject with a meaningful explanation of the logic used in such decision making in certain circumstances, and safeguards must be implemented to safeguard individual rights, including the right to obtain human intervention and to contest any decision. Further, California recently introduced a law requiring disclosure of chatbot functionality and more US states are contemplating similar laws. \n",
      "\n",
      "Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with consumer protection, data privacy or data security laws, rules, and regulations; policies; or enforcement notices and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit) could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, \n",

      "consumer rights groups, government agencies, or others. We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, and diversion of internal resources. We could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages or fines or be required to make changes to our business. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant negative publicity, and an erosion of trust. If any of these events were to occur, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we fail to prevent data security breaches, there may be damage to our brand and reputation, material financial penalties, and legal liability, along with a decline in use of our platform, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are risks of security breaches both on and off our systems as we increase the types of technology we use to operate our platform, including mobile apps and third-party payment processing providers, and as we collaborate with third parties that may need to process our Host or guest data or have access to our infrastructure. The evolution of technology systems introduces ever more complex security risks that are difficult to predict and defend against. Further, there has been a surge in widespread cyber-attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the frequency and scope of cyber-attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated data security risks. An increasing number of companies, including those with significant online operations, have recently disclosed breaches of their security, some of which involved sophisticated tactics and techniques allegedly attributable to organized criminal enterprises or nation-state actors. While we take measures to guard against the type of activity that can lead to data breaches, the techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are unknown until launched against a target. As such, we may be unable to anticipate these tactics and techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, with a large geographically disparate employee base, we are not immune from the possibility of a malicious insider compromising our information systems and infrastructure. This risk has grown in light of the greater adoption of remote work. We also have a distributed community support organization including third-party providers that have access to personal information and systems. We and other companies in our industry have dealt with incidents involving such insiders exfiltrating the personal data of customers, stealing corporate trade secrets and key financial metrics, and illegally diverting funds. No series of measures can fully safeguard against a sufficiently determined and skilled insider threat. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, bad actors have targeted and will continue to target our Hosts and guests directly with attempts to breach the security of their accounts or management systems, such as through phishing attacks where a third party attempts to infiltrate our systems or acquire information by posing as a legitimate inquiry or electronic communication, which are fraudulent identity theft schemes designed to appear as legitimate communications from us or from our Hosts or guests, partners, or vendors. We have seen many instances of our Hosts and guests falling prey to such schemes, which result in their accounts being taken over by fraudsters intent on perpetrating fraud against them, other users, and our platform. Bad actors may also employ other schemes aimed at defrauding our Hosts or guests in ways that we may not anticipate or be able to adequately guard against. Even if phishing and spamming attacks and other fraud schemes are not carried out through our systems, victims may nevertheless seek recovery from us. Because of our prominence, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific scheme or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of our offerings, services, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our Hosts and guests may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing Hosts and guests and attract new Hosts and guests. The ability of fraudsters to directly target our Hosts and guests with fraudulent communications, or cause an account takeover, exposes us to significant financial fraud risk, including costly litigation, which is difficult to fully mitigate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, our practice is to encrypt certain sensitive data when it is in transit and at rest. However, advances in computer capabilities, increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other developments may result in our failure or inability to adequately protect sensitive data. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic intrusions that our security measures may not detect. We have experienced security incidents in the past, and we may face additional attempted security intrusions in the future. Any circumvention of our security measures could result in the misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, interrupt our operations, result in financial loss, damage our computers or those of our Hosts and guests, or otherwise cause damage to our reputation and business. Further, the ability to bypass our information security controls could degrade our trust and safety programs, which could expose individuals to a risk of physical harm or violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that certain personal data has been exfiltrated, accessed, or used inappropriately, we may need to inform privacy regulators across the world, as well as the Hosts or guests whose data was stolen, accessed, or misused. This may subject us to significant regulatory fines and penalties. Further, under certain regulatory schemes, such as the CCPA, we may be liable for statutory damages on a per breached record basis, irrespective of any actual damages or harm to the individual. This means that in the event of a breach we could face government scrutiny or consumer class actions alleging statutory damages amounting to hundreds of millions, and possibly billions of dollars. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on third-party service providers, including financial institutions, to process some of our data and that of our Hosts and guests, including payment information, and any failure by such third parties to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or disclosure of, such information could have adverse consequences for us similar to an incident directly on our systems. We have acquired and will continue to acquire companies that are vulnerable to security breaches, and we may be responsible for any security breaches of these newly acquired companies. While we conduct due diligence of these companies, we do not have access to the full operating history of the companies and cannot be certain there have not been security breaches prior to our acquisition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We expend, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources to protect against security related incidents and address problems caused by such incidents. Even if we were to expend more resources, regulators and complainants may not deem our efforts sufficient, and \n",
      "\n",
      "regardless of the expenditure, the risk of security related incidents cannot be fully mitigated. We have a heightened risk of security breaches due to some of our operations being located in certain international jurisdictions. Any actual or alleged security breaches or alleged violations of federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations relating to data privacy and data security could result in mandated user notifications, litigation, government investigations, significant fines, and expenditures; divert management&#8217;s attention from operations; deter people from using our platform; damage our brand and reputation; force us to cease operations for some length of time; and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Defending against claims or litigation based on any security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, will be costly and may cause reputation harm. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, denial of coverage as to any specific claim, or any change or cessation in our insurance policies and coverages, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform, to effectively implement updates to our systems and to appropriately monitor and maintain our systems. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or backdoors. Some errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or backdoors in our software code have not been and may not be discovered until after the code has been released. We have, from time to time, found defects or errors in our system and software limitations that have resulted in, and may discover additional issues in the future that could result in, platform unavailability or system disruption, or the inability of our systems to implement timely updates that are required for regulatory compliance. For example, defects or errors have resulted in and could result in the delay in making payments to Hosts or overpaying or underpaying Hosts, which would impact our cash position and may cause Hosts to lose trust in our payment operations. Any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or backdoors discovered in our code or systems released to production or found in third-party software, including open source software, that is incorporated into our code, any misconfigurations of our systems, or any unintended interactions between systems could result in poor system performance, an interruption in the availability of our platform, incorrect payments, incorrect calculations, search ranking problems, Host account takeovers, fraudulent listings, issues with chatbot behavior, inadvertent failure to effectively comply with legal, tax, or regulatory requirements, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of existing and potential Hosts and guests, loss of revenue, liability for damages, a failure to comply with certain legal or tax reporting obligations, and regulatory inquiries or other proceedings, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

In addition, Northern California has recently experienced, and may continue to experience power outages during the fire season and our headquarters does not have power generator backup to maintain full business continuity. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our headquarters, any third-party cloud hosting facilities, or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and result in lengthy interruptions or delays of our platform and services. \n",

      "Our systems and operations are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, and similar misconduct from external sources and malicious insiders. Our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing attacks on our systems, and any such attack could cause significant interruptions in our operations. For instance, from time to time, we have experienced distributed denial-of-service type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our platform slow or unavailable for periods of time. There are numerous other potential forms of attack, such as phishing, account takeovers, malicious code injections, ransomware or other extortion-based attempts, and the attempted use of our platform to launch a denial-of-service attack against another party, each of which could cause significant interruptions in our operations or involve us in legal or regulatory proceedings. Reductions in the availability and response time of our online platform could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such attack on our systems and measures we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customers. These issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and the variety of services we offer, and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced and available. Successful attacks could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation, and could prevent consumers from booking or visiting our platform during the attack, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "In the event of certain system failures, we may not be able to switch to back-up systems immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged. We have experienced system failures from time to time. In addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a significant amount of consumer questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our community support team. Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate and significant loss of revenue, an increase in community support costs, harm to our reputation, and could result in some consumers switching to our competitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system failures, our brand and reputation could be permanently and significantly harmed, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. While we have taken and continue to take steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems, these steps are expensive and may not be completely effective in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur. \n",

      "We use both internally developed systems and third-party systems to operate our platform, including transaction and payment processing, and financial and accounting systems. If the number of consumers using our platform increases substantially, or if critical third-party systems stop operating as designed, we may need to significantly upgrade, expand, or repair our transaction and payment processing systems, financial and accounting systems, and other infrastructure. We may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner, and depending on the systems affected, our transaction and payment processing, and financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our Hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage Hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the United States (federal, state, and local) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We have received communications from numerous foreign, federal, state, and local governments regarding the application of tax laws or regulations to our business or demanding data about our Hosts and guests to aid in threatened or actual enforcement actions against our Hosts and guests. In many jurisdictions where applicable, we have agreed to collect and remit taxes on behalf of our Hosts. We have been subject to complaints by, and are involved in a number of lawsuits brought by, certain government entities for alleged responsibility for direct and indirect taxes. In some jurisdictions we are in dispute with respect to past and future taxes. A number of jurisdictions have proposed or implemented new tax laws or interpreted existing laws to explicitly apply various taxes to businesses like ours. Laws and regulations relating to taxes as applied to our platform, and to our Hosts and guests, vary greatly among jurisdictions, and it is difficult or impossible to predict how such laws and regulations will be applied. \n",
      "\n",
      "The application of indirect taxes, such as lodging taxes, hotel, sales and use tax, privilege taxes, excise taxes, VAT, goods and services tax, digital services taxes, harmonized sales taxes, business tax, and gross receipt taxes (together, &#8220;indirect taxes&#8221;) to e-commerce activities such as ours and to our Hosts or guests is a complex and evolving issue. Some of such tax laws or regulations hold us responsible for the reporting, collection, and payment of such taxes, and such laws could be applied to us for transactions conducted in the past as well as transactions in the future. Many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. New or revised foreign, federal, state, or local tax regulations may subject us or our Hosts and guests to additional indirect, income, and other taxes, and depending upon the jurisdiction could subject us or our Hosts and guests to significant monetary penalties and fines for non-payment of taxes. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering adopting or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including digital platform revenue-based taxes, targeting online sharing platforms and online marketplaces, and new obligations to collect Host income taxes, sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on digital platforms. We may recognize additional tax expenses and be subject to additional tax liabilities, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by additional taxes of this nature or additional taxes or penalties resulting from our failure to comply with any reporting, collection, and payment obligations. We accrue a reserve for such taxes when the likelihood is probable that such taxes apply to us, and upon examination or audit, such reserves may be insufficient. \n",
      "\n",
      "New or revised taxes and, in particular, the taxes described above and similar taxes would likely increase the price paid by guests, the cost of doing business for our Hosts, discourage Hosts and guests from using our platform, and lead to a decline in revenue, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies for tax reporting purposes, our Hosts, guests, and regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with data privacy and data security policies, notices, and laws and commence proceedings or actions against us. If we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement on the interpretation of the law, we are likely to face enforcement action, engage in litigation, face increased regulatory scrutiny, and experience an adverse impact in our relationships with governments. Our competitors may arrive at different or novel solutions to the application of taxes to analogous businesses that could cause our Hosts and guests to leave our platform in favor of conducting business on the platforms of our competitors. This uncertainty around the application of taxes and the impact of those taxes on the actual or perceived value of our platform may also cause guests to use OTAs, hotels, or other traditional travel services. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We devote significant resources, including management time, to the application and interpretation of laws and working with various jurisdictions to clarify whether taxes are applicable and the amount of taxes that apply. The application of indirect taxes to our Hosts, guests, and our platform significantly increases our operational expenses as we build the infrastructure and tools to capture data and to report, collect, and remit taxes. Even if we are able to build the required infrastructure and tools, we may not be able to complete them in a timely fashion, in particular given the speed at which regulations and their interpretations can change, which could harm our relationship with governments and our reputation, and result in enforcement actions and litigation. The lack of uniformity in the laws and regulations relating to indirect taxes as applied to our platform and to our Hosts and guests further increases the operational and financial complexity of our systems and processes, and introduces potential for errors or incorrect tax calculations, all of which are costly to our business and results of operations. Certain regulations may be so complex as to make it infeasible for us to be fully compliant. As our business operations expand or change, including as a result of introducing new or enhanced offerings, tiers or features, or due to acquisitions, the application of indirect taxes to our business and to our Hosts and guests will further change and evolve, and could further increase our liability for taxes, discourage Hosts and guests from using our platform, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

We, including through our Hosts, operate in certain areas where the risk of natural or climate-related disaster or other catastrophic losses exists, and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us, our Hosts&#8217; property or the surrounding area. For example, to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns or an increase in extreme weather events, our coastal destinations could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels causing damage to our Hosts&#8217; properties and result in a reduced number of listings in these areas. Other destinations could experience extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, shortages of water, droughts, wildfires, and other extreme weather events that make those destinations less desirable. Climate change may also affect our business by increasing the cost of, or making unavailable, property insurance on terms our Hosts find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs for our Hosts, including the availability and cost of water or energy, and requiring our Hosts to expend funds as they seek to repair and protect their properties in connection with such events. As a result of the foregoing and other climate-related issues, our Hosts may decide to remove their listings from our platform. If we are unable to provide listings in certain areas due to climate change, we may lose both Hosts and guests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

We recognize revenue upon the completion of a check-in. As our business matures, other seasonal trends may develop, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we saw a significant geographic mix shift towards bookings in North America, entire homes, and non-urban destinations, all of which tend to have higher average daily rates. These trends and their impact on our average daily rate may change as the pandemic eases and cross-border travel and urban destinations recover. \n",

In addition, we experience a difference in timing between when a booking is made and when we recognize revenue, which ordinarily occurs upon check-in. The effect of significant downturns in bookings in a particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods because of this timing in revenue recognition. Moreover, we base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates for revenue that may turn out to be inaccurate. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations.

There can be no assurance that our service providers will anticipate or prevent all types of attacks or that any security measures will be effective against all types of cybersecurity threats and risks. Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques that circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove forensic evidence, which means that our third-party providers may be unable to detect, investigate, contain or recover from future attacks or incidents in a timely or effective manner. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased cybersecurity risk as a result of global remote working dynamics that present additional opportunities for threat actors to engage in social engineering (for example, phishing) and to exploit vulnerabilities in non-corporate networks. Our service providers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events, and they may be subject to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, each of which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf.

Over time, we expect to make travel insurance available to guests in additional countries. In the United States, travel insurance products are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which we transact business by state insurance departments. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of consumers. States have also adopted legislation defining and prohibiting unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts and practices in the business of insurance that may apply to insurance agencies. Noncompliance with any of such state statutes may subject us to regulatory action by the relevant state insurance regulator, and, in certain states, private litigation. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that any new laws, rules or regulations, or unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules or regulations, may have on our business and financial results. States also regulate various aspects of the contractual relationships between insurers and independent agents. State insurance regulators may also conduct periodic examinations, the results of which could give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive, or other corrective action. Similarly, travel insurance products are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the applicable regulators in the United Kingdom and the European Union.

Meeting the community support expectations of our Hosts and guests requires significant time and resources from our community support team and significant investment in staffing, technology, including automation and machine learning to improve efficiency, infrastructure, policies, and community support tools. The failure to develop the appropriate technology, infrastructure, policies, and community support tools, or to manage or properly train our community support team, could compromise our ability to resolve questions and complaints quickly and effectively. The number of our Hosts and guests has grown significantly and such growth, as well as any future growth, will put additional pressure on our community support organization and our technology organization. In addition, as we service a global customer base and continue to grow outside of North America and Europe, we need to be able to provide effective support that meets our Hosts&#8217; and guests&#8217; needs and languages globally at scale. Our service is staffed based on complex algorithms that map to our business forecasts. Any volatility in those forecasts could lead to staffing gaps that could impact the quality of our service. We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience backlog incidents that lead to substantial delays or other issues in responding to requests for customer support, which may reduce our ability to effectively retain Hosts and guests. \n",

Reliance on these third parties requires that we provide proper guidance and training for their employees, maintain proper controls and procedures for interacting with our community, and ensure acceptable levels of quality and customer satisfaction are achieved. If our community support third-party service providers are unable to attract, retain and train adequate staffing, there could be an adverse impact on the experience of our Hosts and guests, which could materially adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

A robust community support effort is costly, and we expect such cost to continue to rise in the future as we grow our business. We have historically seen a significant number of community support inquiries from Hosts and guests.

We offer integrated payments to our Hosts and guests in over 40 currencies. Revenue could be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations. Generally speaking, U.S. dollar strength adversely impacts the translation of the portion of our revenue that is generated in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 50% of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which adversely impacted total revenue by 6%. We also have foreign exchange risk with respect to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of Hosts and guests, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, and our financial results are affected by the remeasurement and translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars, which is reflected in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Furthermore, our platform generally enables guests to make payments in the currency of their choice to the extent that the currency is supported by Airbnb, which may not match the currency in which the Host elects to get paid. In those cases, we bear the currency risk of both the guest payment as well as the Host payment due to timing differences in such payments. We may also risk currency rate and logic confusion by Hosts or guests if they do not understand the currency shown. \n",

      "In the first quarter of 2023, we initiated a foreign exchange cash flow hedging program to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations on revenue. However, hedging transactions may not successfully mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations, and our hedging positions may be partial or may not exist at all in the future. While we have and may choose to enter into transactions to hedge portions of our revenue and balance sheet exposures in the future, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate exposure. \n",

      "Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and determine the value of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including those of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Airbnb.

      "We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. For example, our 2008 to 2022 tax years remain subject to examination in the United States and California due to tax attributes and statutes of limitations, and our 2018 to 2022 tax years remain subject to examination in Ireland. We are currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) for the years 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018. We are continuing to respond to inquiries related to these examinations. In December 2020, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (&#8220;NOPA&#8221;) from the IRS for the 2013 tax year relating to the valuation of our international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. The notice proposed an increase to our U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of $1.3 billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $1.0 billion. We disagree with the proposed adjustment and intend to vigorously contest it. In February 2021, we submitted a protest to the IRS describing our disagreement with the proposed adjustment and requesting the case be transferred to the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (&#8220;IRS Appeals&#8221;). In December 2021, we received a rebuttal from the IRS with the same proposed adjustments that were in the NOPA. In January 2022, we entered into an administrative dispute process with IRS Appeals. We will continue to pursue all available remedies to resolve this dispute, including petitioning the U.S. Tax Court (&#8220;Tax Court&#8221;) for redetermination if an acceptable outcome cannot be reached with IRS Appeals, and if necessary, appealing the Tax Court&#8217;s decision to the appropriate appellate court.

      "The determination of our worldwide provision for (benefit from) income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future tax expense could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. For example, we have previously incurred losses in the United States and certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the United States and this could continue to happen in the future. We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities relating to indirect or other non-income taxes, as described in our risk factor titled &#8220;&#8212; Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our Hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage Hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform.&#8221; Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;) was signed into law in the United States.

In addition, many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and states, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries and states where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. For example, in Italy, a 2017 law requires short-term rental platforms that process payments to collect and remit Host income tax and tourist tax, amongst other obligations. Airbnb has challenged this law before the Italian courts and the CJEU, but if we are unsuccessful this will lead to further compliance and potentially significant prior and future tax obligations. In December 2022, the CJEU found that European law does not prohibit member states from passing legislation requiring short-term rental platforms to withhold income taxes from their hosts, however a requirement to appoint tax representative (on which the 2017 law and the withholding obligations are based) is contrary to EU law and the case will now return to the national court. Airbnb&#8217;s subsidiary in Italy and subsidiary in Ireland are subject to tax audits in Italy, including in relation to permanent establishment, transfer pricing, and withholding obligations. Such audits could result in the imposition of potentially significant prior and future tax obligations. \n",

      "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and issued a report in 2015 and an interim report in 2018 detailing 15 key actions aimed at ensuring profits are taxed where the economic activities generating those profits are performed and where value is created. Work continues to be undertaken by the project with regard to each action, and new recommendations are regularly made, including proposed new legislation. Recent examples include the implementation of minimum standards in local legislation to neutralize the effects of hybrid mismatches and to appropriately tax controlled foreign companies.

As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income (including indirect) taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, among others, have each proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which includes business activities on digital platforms and would likely apply to our business. In December 2022, the EU unanimously agreed to implement the minimum tax rate legislation by December 31, 2023 in all Member States, though whether this is practically achievable is currently unknown. Several other countries including Australia, Canada, Colombia, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have also committed to implement similar legislation within the same timeframe. \n",

Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that some of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future taxable income, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation&#8217;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change taxable income or income tax liabilities may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable income or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us. \n",

      "As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our employees and third-party vendors and service providers began working remotely. In 2022, we formally adopted our Live and Work Anywhere policy, which permits the majority of our employees to work remotely. Remote working may subject us to operational challenges and risks. For example, a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event may impact our employees&#8217; ability to work remotely. In addition, members of our workforce who work remotely may not have access to technology that is as robust as that in our offices, which could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to those remote workers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. We may also be exposed to risks associated with the locations of remote workers, including compliance with local laws and regulations or exposure to compromised internet infrastructure. Allowing members of our workforce to work remotely may create intellectual property risk if employees create intellectual property on our behalf while residing in a jurisdiction with unenforced or uncertain intellectual property laws. Further, if employees fail to inform us of changes in their work location, we may be exposed to additional risks without our knowledge. Remote working may also result in consumer, privacy, information technology and cybersecurity, and fraud risks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, our reduction in workforce in May 2020 and remote work arrangements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic caused us to recognize an impairment of certain of our real property lease arrangements, and depending on the duration and extent of the remote work arrangements under our Live and Work Anywhere working model, we may incur additional impairment charges related to our real property lease agreements. \n",

      "Our transition to full or predominantly remote work environments also presents significant challenges to maintaining compliance with country and state requirements such as employee income tax withholding, the recording of reserves to cover withholding corrections or penalties, remittance and reporting, payroll registration, and workers&#8217; compensation insurance. Additionally, foreign tax authorities may assert that certain of our entities have created permanent establishment in their countries which could result in additional corporate income taxes and employee payroll withholding obligations.

Our business requires highly skilled technical, engineering, design, product, data analytics, marketing, business development, and community support personnel, including executive-level employees, who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. Competition for qualified employees and executive-level employees is intense in our industry and jurisdictions where we operate. The loss of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate employees required for the planned expansion of our business would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition and impair our ability to grow. \n",

As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our programs or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past. We have a number of current employees, including our founders, who hold equity in our company. As a result, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate these employees, and the value of their holdings could affect their decisions about whether or not they continue to work for us. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may be adversely affected by declines in our stock price. If we \n",

      "People regularly access the Internet through mobile phones, tablets, handheld computers, voice-assisted speakers, television set-top devices, smart televisions, wearables, and automobile in-dash systems. These devices enable new modalities of interaction, such as conversational user interfaces, and new intermediaries, such as &#8220;super-apps&#8221; like WeChat, where consumers can use many online services without leaving a particular app. We anticipate that the use of these means of access will continue to grow and that usage through desktop computers will continue to decline, especially in certain regions of the world experiencing the highest rate of Internet adoption. The functionality and user experiences associated with these alternative devices, such as a smaller screen size or lack of a screen, may make the use of our platform through such devices more difficult than through a desktop computer, lower the use of our platform, and make it more difficult for our Hosts to upload content to our platform. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns can differ on alternative devices, and it is uncertain how the proliferation of mobile devices will impact the use of our platform and services. Mobile consumers may also be unwilling to download multiple apps from multiple companies providing similar services leading such consumers to opt to use one of our competitors&#8217; services instead of ours. As a result, brand recognition and the consumer experience with our mobile apps will likely become increasingly important to our business. In addition, these new modalities create opportunities for device or systems companies, such as Amazon, Apple, and Google, to control the interaction with our consumers and disintermediate existing platforms such as ours. \n",
      "\n",
      "We need to provide solutions for consumers who are limited in the size of the app they can support on their mobile devices and address latency issues in countries with lower bandwidth for both desktop and mobile devices. Because our platform contains data-intensive media, these issues are exacerbated. As new devices, operating systems, and platforms continue to be released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our offerings and features to them, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of our offerings and features. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our success will also depend on the interoperability of our offerings with a range of third-party technologies, systems, networks, operating systems, and standards, including iOS and Android; the availability of our mobile apps in app stores and in &#8220;super-app&#8221; environments; and the creation, maintenance, and development of relationships with key participants in related industries, some of which may also be our competitors. In addition, if accessibility of various apps is limited by executive order or other government actions, the full functionality of devices may not be available to our customers. Moreover, third-party platforms, services and offerings are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with those of third parties. If we lose such interoperability, we experience difficulties or increased costs in integrating our offerings into alternative devices or systems, or manufacturers or operating systems elect not to include our offerings, make changes that degrade the functionality of our offerings, or give preferential treatment to competitive products, the growth of our community and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. This risk may be exacerbated by the frequency with which consumers change or upgrade their devices. In the event consumers choose devices that do not already include or support our platform or do not install our mobile apps when they change or upgrade their devices, our traffic and Host and guest engagement may be harmed. \n",

Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt our platform and services to evolving industry standards and local preferences and to continually innovate and improve the performance, features, and reliability of our platform and services in response to competitive offerings and the evolving demands of Hosts and guests. Our future success will also depend on our ability to adapt to emerging technologies such as tokenization, cryptocurrencies, new authentication technologies, such as biometrics, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and cloud technologies. As a result, we intend to continue to spend significant resources maintaining, developing, and enhancing our technologies and platform; however, these efforts may be more costly than expected and may not be successful. For example, we may not make the appropriate investments in new technologies, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, technological innovation often results in unintended consequences such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and other system failures. Any such bug, vulnerability, or failure, especially in connection with a significant technical implementation or change, could result in lost business, harm to our brand or reputation, consumer complaints, and other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Another critical component to our future success will be our ability to integrate new or emerging payment methods into our platform to offer alternative payment solutions to consumers. Alternate payment providers such as Alipay, Paytm, and WeChat Pay operate closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both consumers and merchants.

The capabilities of criminal fraudsters, combined with individuals&#8217; susceptibility to fraud may cause our Hosts and guests to be subject to ongoing account takeovers and identity fraud issues. While we have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud, there is no guarantee that they will be successful and they require continuous improvement and optimization of continually evolving forms of fraud to be effective. Our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes, which have become increasingly common and sophisticated, could be adversely impacted by the adoption of new payment methods, the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms, including mobile and other devices, and our growth in certain regions, including in regions with a history of elevated fraudulent activity. We expect that technically-knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent our anti-fraud systems including through account takeovers and cybersecurity breaches. In addition, the payment card networks have rules around acceptable chargeback ratios. If we are unable to effectively combat fictitious listings and fraudulent bookings on our platform, combat the use of fraudulent or stolen credit cards, or otherwise maintain or lower our current levels of chargebacks, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or be unable to continue to accept card payments because payment card networks have revoked our access to their networks, any of which would materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Our payments platform is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, transactions in violation of economic and trade sanctions, corruption and bribery, terrorist financing, fraudulent listings, Host account takeovers, or the facilitation of other illegal activity. Use of our payments platform for illegal or improper uses has subjected us, and may subject us in the future, to claims, lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or requests, which could result in liability and reputational harm for us. We have taken measures to detect and reduce fraud and illegal activities, but these measures need to be continually improved and may add friction to our booking process. These measures may also not be effective against fraud and illegal activities, particularly new and continually evolving forms of circumvention. If these measures do not succeed in reducing fraud, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

As we expand and localize our international activities, we have and will become increasingly subject to the laws of additional countries or geographies. In addition, because we facilitate bookings on our platform worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating our payments platform outside of the United States often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations. \n",

In addition, we may be forced to restrict or change our operations or business practices, make product changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. The complexity of global regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions, and have an adverse impact on, or result in the termination of, our relationships with financial institutions and other service providers on whom we rely for payment processing services. Our ability to track and verify transactions to comply with these regulations, including the ones described in this risk factor, require a high level of internal controls.

In many cases, strong customer authentication requires our UK and EEA guests to engage in additional steps to authenticate payment transactions and EEA Hosts to perform authentication upon access to their Airbnb payout account or modification of their payout account information. These additional authentication requirements may make our platform experience for Hosts and guests in the United Kingdom and EEA substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which our customers use our platform or could cause some Hosts and guests to stop using our platform entirely, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "In many countries or geographies, it is and may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider, electronic money institution, financial institution, or otherwise. In such instances, we partner with local banks and licensed payment processors to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency. Local regulators may slow or halt payments to Hosts conducted through local banks and licensed payment processors or otherwise prohibit or impede us from doing business in a jurisdiction. We may be required to apply for various additional licenses, certifications, and regulatory approvals, including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or their interpretations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to (or decide to) obtain any such licenses, certifications, and approvals. \n",

      "There are substantial costs and potential changes to our offerings involved in obtaining, maintaining, and renewing licenses, certifications, and approvals globally. Our payments entities are subject to inspections, examinations, supervision, and regulation by each relevant regulating authority, including, within the United States, by each state in which Airbnb Payments is licensed. We could be subject to significant fines or other enforcement actions if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance and internal controls, risk management, data privacy, data security and data localization, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other laws and requirements, including those imposed on UK EMIs and Luxembourg payments institutions.

      "\n",
      "We are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the U.S. and the countries from which we provide services. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which is empowered to conduct rulemaking and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. We are subject to a number of such federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations, as well as related state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and its implementing Regulation E. Regulation E applies to certain services provided by Airbnb Payments and requires us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer, among other requirements. In addition, the CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, and new model disclosures. \n",

      "We could be subject to fines or other penalties if we are found to have violated the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices or other consumer financial protection laws enforced by the CFPB or other agencies. The CFPB&#8217;s authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties, including plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys&#8217; fees. The Dodd-Frank Act also empowers state attorneys general and other state officials to enforce federal consumer protection laws under specified conditions. Various government offices and agencies, including various state agencies and state attorneys general (as well as the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Justice), have the authority to conduct reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) involving us or our subsidiaries. These examinations, inquiries, and proceedings could result in, among other things, substantial fines, penalties, or changes in business practices that may require us to incur substantial costs. \n",
      "\n",
      "We provide payment services that may be subject to various U.S. state and federal data privacy and data security laws and regulations. Relevant federal privacy and security laws include the GLBA, which (along with its implementing regulations) restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also \n",

      "In addition to UK and Luxembourg payments-related consumer protection laws that are applicable to our business, regulators in European Union member states could notify APUK and APLux of local consumer protection laws that apply to our businesses, and could also seek to persuade the UK and Luxembourg regulators to order APUK or APLux to conduct their activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in EU countries. \n",

      "\n",
      "We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world, including the BSA. Among other things, the BSA requires money services businesses (including money transmitters such as Airbnb Payments) to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records. The BSA prohibits, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. In connection with and when required by regulatory requirements, we make information available to certain U.S. federal and state, as well as certain foreign, government agencies to assist in the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations. In certain circumstances, we may be required by government agencies to deny transactions that may be related to persons suspected of money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activities, and it is possible that we may inadvertently deny transactions from customers who are making legal money transfers. Regulators in the United States and globally may require us to further revise or expand our compliance programs, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. In the United Kingdom and European Union, the implementation of further anti-money laundering requirements and regulations may make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Penalties for non-compliance with the European Union&#8217;s Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (&#8220;MLD4&#8221;) could include fines of up to 10% of APLux&#8217;s total annual turnover. In April 2018, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission&#8217;s proposal for a Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (&#8220;MLD5&#8221;), which has now been implemented in the national laws of EU Member States and which contains more stringent provisions in certain areas, which will increase compliance costs. Similar penalties are available to the UK Financial Conduct Authority in relation to APUK pursuant to the UK&#8217;s implementation of the EU Money Laundering Directives in the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017/692 (as amended). \n",

      "We are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by governments where we operate, including agencies of the U.S. government (including without limitation regulations administered and enforced by OFAC, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Commerce Department), the Council of the European Union, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation of His Majesty&#8217;s Treasury in the United Kingdom (&#8220;OFSI&#8221;) and the Ministry of Finance and Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier of Luxembourg. These economic and trade sanctions generally prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with certain specified countries, regions, governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated, such as individuals and entities included on OFAC&#8217;s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (&#8220;SDN List&#8221;), subject to EU/UK asset freezes, or other sanctions measures. Any future economic and trade sanctions imposed in jurisdictions where we have significant business could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our ability to track and verify transactions and otherwise to comply with these regulations require a high level of internal controls. We maintain policies and procedures to implement these internal controls, which we periodically assess and update to the extent we identify compliance gaps. We routinely report to OFAC on payments we have rejected or blocked pursuant to OFAC sanctions regulations and on possible violations of those regulations. We have also reported to OFSI on dealings with persons subject to UK sanctions and to the Luxembourg Ministry of Finance on dealings with persons subject to EU sanctions. There is a risk that, despite the internal controls that we have in place, we have engaged in transactions inconsistent with applicable sanctions laws. Any non-compliance with economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations or related investigations could result in claims or actions against us and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As our business continues to grow and regulations change, we may be required to make additional investments in our internal controls or modify our business. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of Russia&#8217;s military action in Ukraine in 2022, governmental authorities in the United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, among others, launched an expansion of coordinated sanctions and export control measures, including sanctions against certain individuals and entities and prohibiting or limiting certain financial and commercial transactions. We had identified certain transactions that potentially implicated those sanctions, we notified the appropriate regulators about these developments, and OFAC initiated a civil investigation of certain payment instructions involving attempted payouts to Hosts' bank accounts at sanctioned Russian banks. In August 2022, OFAC closed the investigation by issuing a cautionary letter with no administrative penalty. \n",

      "transmission of card data to help prevent credit card fraud. If we fail to comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, including the PCI DSS, we would be in breach of our contractual obligations to payment processors and merchant banks. Such failure to comply may damage our relationships with payment card networks, subject us to restrictions, fines, penalties, damages, and civil liability, and could eventually prevent us from processing or accepting payment cards, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to comply with, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to make their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. Further, there is no guarantee that, even if we comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, we will be able to maintain our payment card acceptance privileges. We also cannot guarantee that our compliance with network rules or the PCI DSS will prevent illegal or improper use of our payments platform or the theft, loss, or misuse of the credit card data of customers or participants, or a security breach. We are also required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, and other assessments of our compliance with the PCI DSS. If an audit, self-assessment, or other assessment indicates that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time-consuming remediation efforts, and we could lose our payment card acceptance privileges. \n",

      "If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted, we would need to find an alternate payment service provider, and we may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment service provider in an acceptable time frame. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by our Hosts and guests. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant losses and, in certain cases, require us to make payments to Hosts out of our funds, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the software and services provided by our third-party payment service providers may fail to meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised, or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to Hosts on our platform, which could make our platform less convenient and desirable to customers and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain Hosts and guests. \n",

Further, our ability to expand our payments activities into additional countries is dependent upon the third-party providers we use to support these activities. As we expand the availability of our payments activities to additional geographies or offer new payment methods to our Hosts and guests in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements, and exposed to heightened fraud risk, which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses. \n",

Our payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us. Credit card transactions result in higher fees to us than transactions made through debit cards. Any material increase in interchange fees in the United States or other geographies, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations imposed by law in some geographies, or other network fees or assessments, or a shift from payment with debit cards to credit cards could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Our ability to manage and account accurately for the cash underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our offerings and tiers, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds.

We have both significant funds flows from and to various financial institutions as a result of our processing of payments from guests to Hosts. As part of our currency hedging activities on these balances, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and manage this exposure in an attempt to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition, or service interruptions at, or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets may be limited by the counterparty&#8217;s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, our ability to process payment transactions via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease.

Additionally, for our equity investments in private companies where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, we record our proportionate share of net income or loss in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. The financial statements provided by these companies are often unaudited.

The companies in which we invest include early-stage companies that may still be developing products and services with limited cash to support the development, marketing, and sales of their products. Further, our ability to liquidate such investments is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition, as no public market currently exists for the securities held in the investees. Valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of a liquid market for the securities of such companies. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we will recognize an expense to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value.

Stock prices of many companies, including travel companies and technology companies, have fluctuated in a manner often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our Class A common stock following our recent initial public offering as a result of the supply and demand forces for newly public companies.

As of December 31, 2022, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock beneficially owned 34.8% of our outstanding capital stock and held 91.6% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, with our directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, and their respective affiliates, beneficially owning 38.5% of our outstanding capital stock and holding 92.1% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the 20-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively continue to control a significant percentage of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until all such outstanding shares of Class B common stock have converted into shares of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, our founders, who collectively held 73.9% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2022, are party to a Voting Agreement under which each founder and his affiliates and certain other entities agree to vote their shares for the election of each individual founder to our board of directors. We and each of our founders are party to a Nominating Agreement under which we and the founders are required to take certain actions to include the founders in the slate of nominees nominated by our board of directors for the applicable class of directors, include them in our proxy statement, and solicit proxies or consents in favor of electing each founder to our board of directors. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.

      "Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes or transfers among our founders, if all of our founders agree to such transfers. Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Class B holder into one share of Class A common stock. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result, it is possible that one or more of the persons or entities holding our Class B common stock could gain significant voting control as other holders of Class B common stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into Class A common stock. In addition, the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. In addition, any future issuances of common stock would be dilutive to holders of Class A common stock. For example, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. Further, each outstanding share of Class H common stock will convert into a share of Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis upon the sale of such share of Class H common stock to any person or entity that is not our subsidiary, which would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. \n",

For example, certain index providers, such as S&#38;P Dow Jones, have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indices, including the S&#38;P 500. Accordingly, the multi-series structure of our common stock makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices may not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Because of the multi-class structure of our common stock, we will likely be excluded from certain indices and we cannot assure that other stock indices will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors.

Share repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions or by any combination of such methods. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The manner, timing and amount of any share repurchases may fluctuate and will be determined by us based on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, our priorities for the use of cash to support our business operations and plans, general business and market conditions, tax laws, and alternative investment opportunities, all of which may be further impacted by macroeconomic conditions and factors, including rising interest rates, and inflation, global conflicts, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our share repurchase program authorization does not have an expiration date nor does it obligate us to acquire any specific number or dollar value of shares. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our common stock. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a 1% excise tax on share repurchases, which would increase the costs associated with repurchasing shares of our common stock. Even if our share repurchase program is fully implemented, it may not enhance long-term stockholder value or may not prove to be the best use of our cash.

Our authorized but unissued shares of Class C common stock are available for issuance with the approval of our board of directors without stockholder approval, except as may be required by the Listing Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;). Because the Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), is not convertible into any other capital stock, and is not listed for trading on an exchange or registered for sale with the SEC, shares of Class C common stock may be less liquid and less attractive to any future recipients of these shares than shares of Class A common stock, although we may seek to list the Class C common stock for trading and register shares of Class C common stock for sale in the future. In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, the holders of our Class B common stock, including our founders who are parties to a Nominating Agreement and a Voting Agreement, may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us that stockholders may otherwise support, and could allow us to take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.

      "Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for an exclusive forum in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, and that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act. \n",

      "Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide, that: (i) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware) will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company, (B) any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent, or stockholder to the company or our stockholders, including without limitation a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (C) any action asserting a claim against the company or any of our current or former director, officer, employee, agent, or stockholder arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (D) any action asserting a claim related to or involving the company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; (ii) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (iii) any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the company will be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions; and (iv) failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause us irreparable harm, and we will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), from bringing such claims in federal court to the extent that the Exchange Act confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable law. \n",

      "We believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and \n",

      "General Risk Factors \n",
      "\n",
      "The value of our marketable securities could decline, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our marketable securities portfolio includes various holdings, types, and maturities. Market values of these investments can be adversely impacted by various factors, including liquidity in the underlying security, credit deterioration, the financial condition of the credit issuer, foreign exchange rates, and changes in interest rates. Our marketable securities, which we consider highly-liquid investments, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&#8217; equity (deficit). Realized gains and losses and other than-temporary impairments are reported within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Our marketable equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the fair value of our marketable equity securities declines, our earnings will be reduced or losses will be increased. Furthermore, our interest income from cash, cash equivalents, and our marketable securities are impacted by changes in interest rates, and a decline in interest rates would adversely impact our interest income. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to rules and regulations established by the SEC and Nasdaq regarding our internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete needed improvements to our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock and your investment. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established by the SEC and Nasdaq. These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel, including senior management. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In support of such certifications, we were required to document and make significant changes and enhancements, including hiring additional personnel, to our internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm provided an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We anticipate to continue investing significant resources to enhance and maintain our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems, and procedures. \n",
      "\n",
      "If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we identify or fail to remediate material weaknesses in our internal controls, or we do not effectively or accurately report our financial performance to the appropriate regulators on a timely basis, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of investor confidence, which could significantly harm our reputation and our stock price, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The failure to successfully implement and maintain accounting systems could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We occasionally implement, modify, retire and change our accounting systems. For example, we are in the process of implementing a new cloud-based enterprise resource planning system in 2023. Such transformations involve risk inherent in the conversion to a new system, including loss of information and potential disruption to normal operations. These changes to our information technology systems may be disruptive, take longer than desired, be more expensive than anticipated, be distracting to management, or fail, causing our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Additionally, if our revenue and other accounting or tax systems do not operate as intended or do not scale with anticipated growth in our business, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected. Any failure to develop, implement, or maintain effective internal controls related to our revenue and other accounting or tax systems and associated reporting could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, if we experience interruptions in service or operational difficulties with our revenue and other accounting or tax systems, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in accounting principles. \n",
      "\n",
      "The accounting for our business is subject to change based on the evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting and financial reporting requirements of the SEC or other regulatory agencies. Adoption of a change in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the adoption of such change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles and accounting policies over financial reporting, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could require significant investment in systems and personnel. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#160; \n",
      "\n",
      "Avoiding regulation under the Investment Company Act may adversely affect our operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which &#8220;investment companies&#8221; are permitted to conduct their business activities. We currently conduct, and intend to continue to conduct, our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We are not engaged primarily, nor do we hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and neither do we intend to own investment securities with a combined value in excess of 40% of the value, as determined by our board of directors, of our total assets, exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items, on an unconsolidated basis. We do, however, make minority investments in companies and acquire other financial instruments from time to time that may be deemed investment securities. We expect to conduct our operations such that the value of those investments will not rise to a level where we might be deemed an investment company, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining the required ratios without taking actions that may adversely affect our operations. For example, to avoid being deemed an investment company we may be required to sell certain of our assets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our Class A common stock. The following material factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors, and oral statements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Risks Related to Our Business \n",
      "\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have materially adversely impacted and may continue to materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, governments have imposed various restrictions, including emergency declarations at the federal, state, and local levels, school and business closings, quarantines, &#8220;shelter at home&#8221; orders, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other social distancing measures, which have had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business and operations and on travel behavior and demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has materially adversely affected our near-term operating and financial results and may continue to materially adversely impact our long-term operating and financial results. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do not believe it is possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business, results of operations, and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic (including the emergence of any variants, which may be more contagious and/or may impact the effectiveness of approved vaccines) both globally and within the United States, the prevalence of local, national, and international travel restrictions (including new or reinstated restrictions as a result of COVID-19 variants), vaccination requirements in connection with travel, vaccination rates in the communities in which we operate, reduced flight volume, the impact on capital and financial markets and on the U.S. and global economies, foreign currencies exchange, and governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in these &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, may materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most of our employees and third-party vendors and service providers are working remotely. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurs that impacts our employees&#8217; ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in material consumer privacy, information technology security, and fraud risks. Our reduction in force in May 2020 and remote work arrangements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic caused us to recognize an impairment of certain of our real property lease arrangements, and depending on the duration and extent of the remote work arrangements, we may incur additional impairment charges related to our real property lease agreements. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have incurred net losses in each year since inception, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. \n",
      "\n",
      "We incurred net losses of $674.3 million, $4.6 billion, and $352.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $6.4 billion. Historically, we have invested significantly in efforts to grow our Host and guest community, introduced new or enhanced offerings and features, increased our marketing spend, expanded our operations, hired additional employees, and enhanced our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "Certain of our offerings and certain regions in which we operate result in listings with lower service fees and will require significant additional investments from us, which could have a materially negative impact on our overall operating margins as these offerings and regions increase in size over time relative to other areas in which we operate. In addition, we have changed, and may in the future reduce, our service fees for strategic or competitive reasons. Any failure to increase our revenue or any failure to manage an increase in our operating expenses could prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability as measured by net income, operating income, or Adjusted EBITDA. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) and other equity awards will continue to be a significant expense in future periods. In addition, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will begin using corporate cash to make required tax payments associated with the vesting of employee RSUs and withhold a corresponding number of shares from employees. We anticipate that we will spend substantial funds to satisfy tax withholding and remittance obligations when we settle employee RSUs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow have declined in prior periods, and this trend could continue . \n",
      "\n",
      "We had Adjusted EBITDA of $(253.3) million, $(250.7) million, and $1.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. Our Free Cash Flow was $97.3 million, $(667.1) million, and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. While our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow increased in 2021, we may experience declines in Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow in the future. Adverse developments in our business, including lower than anticipated revenue, higher than anticipated operating expenses, impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and net unfavorable changes in working capital, could result in a negative trend in our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. If our future Adjusted EBITDA or Free Cash Flow fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, it is likely to have a materially adverse effect on our stock price.

      "A softening of demand, whether caused by events outside of our control, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, changes in Host and guest preferences, any of the other factors described above, or in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or otherwise, may result in decreased revenue and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "\n",
      "Our business depends on Hosts maintaining their listings on our platform and engaging in practices that encourage guests to book those listings, including increasing the number of nights and experiences that are available to book, providing timely responses to inquiries from guests, offering a variety of desirable and differentiated listings at competitive prices that meet the expectations of guests, and offering exceptional hospitality, services, and experiences to guests. These practices are outside of our direct control. If Hosts do not establish or maintain a sufficient number of listings and availability for listings, the number of Nights and Experiences Booked declines for a particular period, or the price charged by Hosts declines, our revenue would decline and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hosts manage and control their spaces and experiences and typically market them on our platform with no obligation to make them available to guests for specified dates and with no obligation to accept bookings from prospective guests. We have had many Hosts list their properties on our platform in one period and cease to offer these properties in subsequent periods for a variety of reasons. While we plan to continue to invest in our Host community and in tools to assist Hosts, these investments may not be successful in growing our Hosts and listings on our platform. In addition, Hosts may not establish or maintain listings if we cannot attract prospective guests to our platform and generate bookings from a large number of guests. If we are unable to retain existing Hosts or add new Hosts, or if Hosts elect to market their listings exclusively with a competitor or cross-list with a competitor, we may be unable to offer a sufficient supply and variety of properties or experiences to attract guests to use our platform. In particular, it is critical that we continue to attract and retain individual Hosts who list their spaces, including private rooms, primary homes, or vacation homes on Airbnb. We attract individual Hosts predominantly through organic channels such as word of mouth and our strong brand recognition. If we are unable to attract and retain individual Hosts in a cost-effective manner, or at all, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "Professional Hosts, including property management companies, serviced apartment providers, and boutique hotels, expand the types of listings available to our guests. These professional Hosts often list on our platform as well as on the platforms of our competitors. We do not control whether professional Hosts provide us with a sizable allocation of rooms and competitive pricing relative to the same properties listed with other services. If we are not able to effectively deploy professional tools, application programming interfaces, and payment processes, work with third-party channel managers, and develop effective sales and account management teams that address the needs of these professional Hosts, we may not be able to attract and retain professional Hosts. If our fee structure and payment terms are not as competitive as those of our competitors, these professional Hosts may choose to provide less inventory and availability with us. Historically, we have seen an increase in the number of, and revenue from, professional Hosts on our platform. The uniqueness of listings on our platform will be negatively impacted if the number of individual Hosts does not grow at the same rate. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the number of listings on Airbnb may decline as a result of a number of other factors affecting Hosts, including: the COVID-19 pandemic; enforcement or threatened enforcement of laws and regulations, including short-term occupancy and tax laws; private groups, \n",
      "\n",
      "such as homeowners, landlords, and condominium and neighborhood associations, adopting and enforcing contracts that prohibit or restrict home sharing; leases, mortgages and other agreements, or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict home sharing; Hosts opting for long-term rentals on other third-party platforms as an alternative to listing on our platform; economic, social, and political factors; perceptions of trust and safety on and off our platform; negative experiences with guests, including guests who damage Host property, throw unauthorized parties, or engage in violent and unlawful acts; and our decision to remove Hosts from our platform for not adhering to our Host standards or other factors we deem detrimental to our community. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that our Host protection programs, including those provided through AirCover, are integral to retaining and acquiring Hosts. AirCover includes but is not limited to our Host Damage Protection program, which protects Hosts against property damage of up to $1 million, and our Host Liability Insurance and Experiences Liability Insurance, which provide liability insurance of up to $1 million to protect our Hosts against qualifying third-party claims for personal injury or property damage. If we discontinue these programs or these programs prove less effective, whether because our payouts under these programs or our insurance premiums become cost prohibitive or for any other reason, then the number of Hosts who list with us may decline. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, higher than normal payments via refunds and travel credit issuance to guests who cancel for reasons related to COVID-19. Under our extenuating circumstances policy, guests who made reservations on or before March 14, 2020 and cannot travel due to the pandemic have been eligible to cancel their reservations for a full cash refund or in some cases travel credit. Similarly, Hosts with reservations confirmed on or before March 14, 2020 who cannot host due to the pandemic have been eligible to cancel under this policy without adverse consequences. A large number of guest cancellations under the policy caused lost earnings for our Hosts. To support our Hosts and lessen the impact of cancellations under our extenuating circumstances policy, we made a $250 million commitment, the majority of which had been distributed as of December 31, 2021, which provides Hosts a portion of the amount they expected to earn from bookings that were canceled under this policy. The reservations eligible for this support program were defined as reservations made on or before March 14, 2020 with a check-in date between March 14, 2020 and May 31, 2020. For these reservations, eligible Hosts are entitled to receive 25% of the amount they would have received from guests under the Host&#8217;s cancellation policies. Because this commitment is limited in amount and timeframe, Hosts will not receive full payment related to guest cancellations, and some Hosts may remove their listings from our platform if they are not satisfied with our policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hosts and guests whose reservations are canceled under our extenuating circumstances policy have had and may continue to have a negative view of such policy and may experience negative financial impacts as a result of such cancellations.

      "Our financial performance is dependent on the strength of the travel and hospitality industries. The outbreak of COVID-19 and emergence of its variants has caused many governments to implement quarantines and significant restrictions on travel or to advise that people remain at home where possible and avoid crowds, which has had a particularly negative impact on cross-border travel. Other events beyond our control, such as unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, tsunamis, floods, severe weather, droughts, extreme temperatures and ambient temperature increases, and volcanic eruptions, the frequency and severity of which may be increasingly impacted by climate change in future years (although it is currently impossible to predict with accuracy the scale of such \n",

Because many of these events or concerns, and the full impact of their effects, are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our platform and services, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Events such as sudden outbreaks of wars or regional instability have led to a large number of localized cancellations and safety concerns, which harm our business and our relationship with our Hosts and guests. In addition, increasing awareness around the impact of air travel on climate change and the impact of over-tourism may adversely impact the travel and hospitality industries and demand for our platform and services, whether due to the imposition of policies and regulations or changing societal attitudes to travel. \n",

      "Our financial performance is also subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, worldwide or regional recession, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, fluctuations in exchange rates, inflation, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, tariffs, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected, which could lead to a decline in the bookings and prices for stays and experiences on our platform and an increase in cancellations, and thus result in lower revenue. Leisure travel in particular, which accounts for a substantial majority of our current business, is dependent on discretionary consumer spending levels. Downturns in worldwide or regional economic conditions have led to a general decrease in leisure travel and travel spending in the past, and similar downturns in the future may materially adversely impact demand for our platform and services. Such a shift in consumer behavior would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

In addition, our current or potential competitors have access to larger user bases and/or inventory for accommodations, and may provide multiple travel products, including flights. As a result, our competitors may be able to provide consumers with a better or more complete product experience and respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or Host and guest requirements or preferences. The global travel industry has experienced significant consolidation, and we expect this trend may continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in a highly competitive industry. Consolidation amongst our competitors will give them increased scale and may enhance their capacity, abilities, \n",

      "There are now numerous competing companies that offer homes for booking, which can be available on our platform, on competing platforms, and through direct booking sites. Some of these competitors also aggregate property listings obtained through various sources, including the websites of property managers. Some of our Hosts have chosen to cross-list their properties, which reduces the availability of such properties on our platform. When properties are cross-listed, the price paid by guests on our platform may be or may appear to be less competitive for a number of reasons, including differences in fee structure and policies, which may cause guests to book through other services, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Certain property managers reach out to our Hosts and guests to incentivize them to list or book directly with them and bypass our platform, and certain Hosts may encourage transactions outside of our platform, which reduces the use of our platform and services. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of our competitors or potential competitors have more established or varied relationships with consumers than we do, and they could use these advantages in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by entering the travel and accommodations businesses. For example, some competitors or potential competitors are creating &#8220;super-apps&#8221; where consumers can use many online services without leaving that company&#8217;s app, e.g., in particular regions, such as Asia, where e-commerce transactions are conducted primarily through apps on mobile devices. If any of these platforms are successful in offering services similar to ours to consumers, or if we are unable to offer our services to consumers within these super-apps, our customer acquisition efforts could be less effective and our customer acquisition costs, including our brand and performance marketing expenses, could increase, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We also face increasing competition from search engines including Google. How Google presents travel search results, and its promotion of its own travel meta-search services, such as Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, or similar actions from other search engines, and their practices concerning search rankings, could decrease our search traffic, increase traffic acquisition costs, and/or disintermediate our platform. These parties can also offer their own comprehensive travel planning and booking tools, or refer leads directly to suppliers, other favored partners, or themselves, which could also disintermediate our platform. In addition, if Google or Apple use their own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor their own or other preferred travel service offerings, or impose policies that effectively disallow us to continue our full product offerings in those channels, it could materially adversely affect our ability to engage with Hosts and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search. \n",
      "\n",
      "Laws, regulations, and rules that affect the short-term rental, long-term rental, and home sharing business have limited and may continue to limit the ability or willingness of Hosts to share their spaces over our platform and expose our Hosts or us to significant penalties, which have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since we began our operations in 2008, there have been and continue to be legal and regulatory developments that affect the short-term rental, long-term rental and home sharing business. Hotels and groups affiliated with hotels have engaged and will likely continue to engage in various lobbying and political efforts for stricter regulations governing our business in both local and national jurisdictions. Other private groups, such as homeowners, landlords, and condominium and neighborhood associations, have adopted contracts or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict short-term rentals, and third-party lease agreements between landlords and tenants, home insurance policies, and mortgages may prevent or restrict the ability of Hosts to list their spaces. These groups and others cite concerns around affordable housing and over-tourism in major cities among other issues, and some state and local governments have implemented or considered implementing rules, ordinances, or regulations governing the short-term or long-term rental of properties and/or home sharing. For example, in December 2021, the EU Commission closed a consultation in relation to a potential EU Short Term Rental Instrument which, if enacted, could have a material impact on the way short-term rentals are regulated in the European Union and the obligations on platforms (including around data sharing or the need to enforce registration schemes). Legislation in other regions also could have a material impact on the way short-term and long-term rentals are regulated. Such regulations include ordinances that restrict or ban Hosts from short-term rentals, long-term rentals, set annual caps on the number of days Hosts can share their homes, require Hosts to register with the municipality or city, or require Hosts to obtain permission before offering short-term rentals. In addition, some jurisdictions regard short-term rental or home sharing as &#8220;hotel use&#8221; and claim that such use constitutes a conversion of a residential property to a commercial property requiring a permitting process. In December 2020, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a Digital Services Act (the &#8220;DSA&#8221;) to modernize the E-Commerce Directive with regard to, among other things, illegal services or content, traceability of business users, and transparency measures, including on the algorithms used for recommendation. The newly proposed instrument is still going through the legislative process. However, once adopted, it could potentially disincentivize certain Hosts to use the platform&#8217;s services by substantially increasing traceability obligations of the platform. Macroeconomic pressures and public policy concerns could continue to lead to new laws and regulations, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or widespread enforcement actions that limit the ability of Hosts to share their spaces. If laws, regulations, rules, or agreements significantly restrict or discourage Hosts in certain jurisdictions from sharing their properties, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "While a number of cities and countries have implemented legislation to address short-term rentals, there are many others that are not yet explicitly addressing or enforcing short-term rental or long-term rental laws, and could follow suit and enact regulations with direct requirements on platforms such as Airbnb. New laws, regulations, government policies, or changes in their interpretations in the over 100,000 cities and towns where we operate entail significant challenges and uncertainties. In the event of any such changes, pre-existing bookings may not be honored and current and future listings and bookings could decline significantly, and our relationship with our Hosts and guests could be negatively impacted, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, if new regulations requiring us to share Host data with such governmental organizations or to ensure that Hosts have a registration or permit number before publishing their listings or some other form of regulation are implemented, our revenue from listings there may be substantially reduced due to the departure from our platform of Hosts who do not wish to share their data or to obtain a registration or permit number. A reduction in supply and cancellations could make our platform less attractive to guests, and any reduction in the number of guests could further reduce the number of Hosts on our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we seek to work with governments, we have in the past, and are likely in the future to, become involved in disputes with government agencies regarding such laws and regulations. For example, some governments have attempted to impose fines on us regarding what they contend is illegal offering of short-term accommodations in violation of applicable laws. Certain jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations that seek to impose various types of taxes, including lodging taxes, often known as transient or occupancy taxes, on our guests, collection and remittance obligations on our Hosts and/or us, and withholding obligations on us, as more fully described in our risk factor titled &#8220;&#8212; Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our Hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage Hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform.&#8221; In addition, some third parties and regulators have asserted that we, through our operations, are subject to regulations with respect to short-term rentals, Host registration, licensing, and other requirements for the listing of accommodations and experiences, such as real estate broker or agent licenses, travel agency licenses, e-commerce platform operator, and insurance-related licenses. We could be held liable and incur significant financial and potential criminal penalties if we are found to have violated any of these regulations. In certain jurisdictions, we have resolved disputes concerning the application of these laws and regulations by agreeing, among other things, to remove listings from our platform at the request of government entities, to require Hosts to enter a permit or registration number or take other action before publishing listings on our platform, to share certain data with government agencies to assist in the enforcement of limits on short-term or long-term rentals as well as the enforcement of safety regulations, and to implement measures to confirm to the government that Hosts are operating in compliance with applicable law. When a government agency seeks to apply laws and regulations in a manner that limits or curtails Hosts&#8217; or guests&#8217; ability or willingness to list and search for accommodations in that particular geography, we have attempted and may continue to attempt through litigation or other means to defend against such application of laws and regulations, but have sometimes been and may continue to be unsuccessful in certain of those efforts. Further, if we or our Hosts and guests were required to comply with laws and regulations, government requests, or agreements with government agencies that adversely impact our relations with Hosts and guests, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. Moreover, if we enter an agreement with a government or governmental agency to resolve a dispute, the terms of such agreement may be publicly available and could create a precedent that may put us in a weaker bargaining position in future disputes with other governments. \n",

      "We are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage Hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Moreover, the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate are distinct and may result in inconsistent or ambiguous interpretations among local, regional, or national laws or regulations applicable to our business. Compliance with laws and regulations of different jurisdictions imposing varying standards and requirements is burdensome for businesses like ours, imposes added cost and increases potential liability to our business, and makes it difficult to realize business efficiencies and economies of scale. For example, we incur significant operational costs to comply with requirements of jurisdictions and cities that have disparate requirements around tax collection, tax reporting, Host registration, limits on lengths of stays, and other regulations, each of which require us to dedicate significant resources to provide the infrastructure and tools needed on our platform for our Hosts to meet these legal requirements and for us to fulfill any obligations we may have. The complexity of our platform and changes required to comply with the large number of disparate requirements can lead to compliance gaps if our internal resources cannot keep up with the pace of regulatory change and new requirements imposed on our platform, or if our platform does not work as intended or has errors or bugs. Environmental, health, and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs, and our Hosts&#8217; costs, to comply with such requirements may increase as a result. New or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect the operation of our Hosts&#8217; properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us. \n",

      "It may be difficult or impossible for us to investigate or evaluate laws or regulations in all cities, countries, and regions. The application of existing laws and regulations to our business and platform can be unclear and may be difficult for Hosts, guests, and us to understand and apply, and are subject to change, as governments or government agencies seek to apply legacy systems of laws or adopt new laws to new online business models in the travel and accommodations industries, including ours. Uncertain and unclear application of such laws and regulations to Host and guest activity and our platform could cause and has caused some Hosts and guests to leave or choose not to use our platform, reduce supply and demand for our platform and services, increase the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, and increase the threat of litigation or enforcement actions related to our platform, all of which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

While we require our Hosts and guests to comply with their own independent legal obligations under our terms of service, we have limited means of enforcing or ensuring the compliance of our Hosts and guests with all applicable legal requirements. Sometimes governments try to hold us responsible for laws that apply to our Hosts and/or guests. Whether applicable to us, our Hosts, and/or our guests, the related consequences arising out of such laws and regulations, including penalties for violations of and costs to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "We take certain measures to comply, and to help Hosts comply, with laws and regulations, such as requiring registration numbers to be displayed on a listing profile for listings in some jurisdictions where such registration is required. These measures, changes to them, and any future measures we adopt could increase friction on our platform, and reduce the number of listings available on our platform from Hosts and bookings by guests, and could reduce the activity of Hosts and guests on our platform. We may be subject to additional laws and regulations which could require significant changes to our platform that discourage Hosts and guests from using our platform. Our newer offerings, such as Airbnb Experiences, are subject to similar or other laws, regulations, and regulatory actions. In particular, if we become more involved in Hosts&#8217; listings and conduct related to bookings, then we are more likely to draw scrutiny and additional regulations from governments and undercut various defenses we may have to claims or attempts to regulate us, which further constrain our business and impose additional liability on us as a platform. \n",

In addition, many jurisdictions have limited social mobility and gatherings. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, governments, corporations, and other authorities may continue to implement restrictions or policies that could further restrict the ability of our Hosts and guests to participate on our platform. \n",

      "There is increased governmental interest in regulating technology companies in areas including privacy, tax, data localization and data access, algorithm-based discrimination, competition, and real estate broker related activities. In addition, increasing governmental interest in, and public awareness of, the impacts and effects of climate change and greater emphasis on sustainability by federal, state, and international governments could lead to further regulatory efforts to address the carbon impact of housing and travel. In particular, the current regulatory landscape regarding climate change (including energy efficiency in buildings), both within the United States and in many other locations where we operate worldwide, is evolving at pace, and is likely to continue to develop in ways that require our business to adapt. As a result, governments may enact new laws and regulations and/or view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past, including laws and regulations which seek to reduce the carbon emissions relating to travel and set minimum energy efficiency requirements for buildings, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In particular, stricter regulation in relation to energy efficiency requirements of buildings could lead to a reduced number of listings in affected jurisdictions. We incur significant expenses and commit significant resources to maintain our platform in compliance with laws and regulations; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully implement technical upgrades and other system implementations in a timely manner since implementations often involve building new infrastructure and tools, which contain the inherent risk of unplanned errors and defects, and in certain instances we may be unable to respond to legislation in a way that fully mitigates any negative impacts our business. \n",

      "Any new or existing laws and regulations applicable to existing or future business areas, including amendments to or repeal of existing laws and regulations, or new interpretations, applications, or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, and materially adversely impact bookings on our platform, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, the laws and regulations that impact our United Kingdom and European Union operations, including payment processing, privacy and data protection, legal protection for platforms, workers&#8217; rights, and intellectual property, will change after the end of the transitional period following the United Kingdom&#8217;s departure from the European Union. The Omnibus Directive also introduces stricter penalties for breaches of consumer protection law. This includes an introduction of fines as a mandatory element of penalties in some situations and higher amounts, as well as additional information requirements. The Collective Redress Directive replaced its predecessor in November 2020. This relatively new Directive allows for the recovery of monetary compensation on behalf of large classes of consumers, and greatly extends the scope to new areas, including for example misleading and comparative advertising, privacy and data protection. The European Union is also reviewing the regulation of digital services, and in December 2020, the European Commission published a draft of the proposed DSA, which is now close to being finalized in 2022 and will introduce a package of legislation intended to update the liability and safety rules for digital platforms, products, and services, which could negatively impact the scope of the limited immunity provided by the E-Commerce Directive. The DSA modernizes the E-Commerce Directive with regard to, among other things, illegal services or content, traceability of business users and transparency measures, including on the algorithms used for recommendation. In parallel, the European Commission also published a legislative proposal to introduce new ex ante regulation of online platforms and new market investigation powers as a separate piece of legislation, the Digital Markets Act (the &#8220;DMA&#8221;), which is expected towards the second half of 2022. Both instruments could be formally adopted by the EU co-legislator in 2022. Some European jurisdictions (such as Germany) have also introduced new competition rules in relation to digital platforms similar to the DMA at the national level, and other jurisdictions (such as the United Kingdom) are in the process of introducing similar new rules. These laws may contain certain regulatory requirements and/or obligations that could negatively impact the business of companies like ours. Furthermore, some of our Hosts or some of our offerings may now or in the future be subject to the European Package Travel Directive, which imposes various obligations upon package providers and upon marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers. Our efforts to influence legislative and regulatory proposals have an uncertain chance of success, could be limited by laws regulating lobbying or advocacy activity in certain jurisdictions, and even if successful, could be expensive and time consuming, and could divert the attention of management from operations. \n",

In many cases, these inquiries, investigations, and proceedings can be complex, time consuming, costly to investigate, and require significant company and also management attention. For certain matters, we are implementing recommended changes to our products, operations, and compliance practices, including enabling tax collection, tax reporting, display of Host registration numbers, and removal of noncompliant listings. We are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of such inquiries, investigations, and proceedings on our business, and such inquiries, investigations, and proceedings could result in damages, large fines and penalties and require changes to our products and operations, and materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. In some instances, applicable laws and regulations do not yet exist or are being adapted and implemented to address certain aspects of our business, and such adoption or change in their interpretation could further alter or impact our business and subject us to future government inquiries, investigations, and proceedings. \n",

In the United States, we have been involved in various lawsuits concerning whether our platform is responsible for alleged wrongful conduct by Hosts who engage in short-term rentals. Claims in such cases have alleged illegal hotel conversions, real estate license requirements, violations of municipal law around short-term occupancy or rentals, unlawful evictions, or violations of lease provisions or homeowners&#8217; association rules. Legal claims have been asserted for alleged discriminatory conduct undertaken by Hosts against certain guests, and for our own platform policies or business practices. Changes to the interpretation of the applicability of fair housing, civil rights or other statutes to our business or the conduct of our users could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as U.S. laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&#8220;DMCA&#8221;), the Stored Communications Act, and the Communications Decency Act (&#8220;CDA&#8221;), and non-U.S. laws such as the European E-Commerce Directive and its national transpositions are interpreted by the courts or otherwise modified or amended, as our platform and services to our Hosts and guests continue to expand, and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable. \n",

We also have had putative class action litigation and government inquiries, and could face additional litigation and government inquiries and fines relating to our business practices, cancellations and other consequences due to natural disasters or other unforeseen events beyond our control such as wars, regional hostilities, health concerns, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19, or law enforcement demands and other regulatory actions. \n",

In several cases, national courts are evaluating whether certain local rules imposing obligations on platforms can be enforced against us. For example, we are challenging laws in various European jurisdictions requiring short-term rental platforms to act as withholding tax agent for Host income taxes, to collect and remit tourist taxes, and to disclose user data. Adverse rulings in these national cases are possible and could result in changes to our business practices in significant ways, increased operating and compliance costs, and lead to a loss of revenue for us. In addition, the European Union is in the final stages of approving the DSA, which will exist in parallel with the E-Commerce Directive and clarify and enhance the rules that apply to platforms. \n",

We also have indemnification agreements with certain of our directors, executive officers, and certain other employees that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.

Moreover, many regulatory inquiries, litigation, legal proceedings, or claims are resolved by settlements that can include both monetary and nonmonetary components. Adverse results or settlements may result in changes in our business practices in significant ways, increased operating and compliance costs, and a loss of revenue. In addition, any litigation or pre-litigation claims against us, whether or not meritorious, are time consuming, require substantial expense, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. We use various software platforms that in some instances have limited functionality which may impede our ability to fully retrieve records. In addition, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. As we continue to grow, regulatory inquiries, litigation, legal proceedings, and other claims will continue to consume significant company resources and adverse results in future matters could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Moreover, regulators in the United States and in other countries may introduce new regulatory regimes that increase potential liability for information or content available on our platform. For example, in the United States, laws such as the CDA, which have previously been interpreted to provide substantial protection to interactive computer service providers, may change and become less predictable or unfavorable by legislative action or juridical interpretation. There have been various federal legislative efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under the CDA, in particular with regards to Section 230 of the CDA, and current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. There is proposed U.S. federal legislation seeking to hold platforms liable for user-generated content, including content related to short-term or long-term rentals. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. \n",

In countries in Asia and Latin America, generally there are not similar statutes as the CDA or E-Commerce Directive. The laws of countries in Asia and Latin America generally provide for direct liability if a platform is involved in creating such content or has actual knowledge of the content without taking action to take it down. Further, laws in some Asian countries also provide for primary or secondary liability, which can include criminal liability, if a platform failed to take sufficient steps to prevent such content from being uploaded. Because liability often flows from information or content on our platform and/or services accessed through our platform, as we continue to expand our offerings, tiers, and scope of business, both in terms of the range of offerings and services and geographical operations, we may face or become subject to additional or different laws and regulations. Our potential liability for information or content created by third parties and posted to our platform could require us to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to such liability, may require us to expend significant resources, may limit the desirability of our platform to Hosts and guests, may cause damage to our brand or reputation, and may cause us to incur time and costs defending such claims in litigation, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

In 2018, the European Commission and a group of European consumer protection authorities (through the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network) investigated our customer terms and price display practices, which required us to make certain changes to our terms and price display practices. If Consumer Protection Regulators find that we are in breach of consumer protection laws, we may be fined or required to change our terms and processes, which may result in increased operational costs. Consumers and certain Consumer Protection Associations may also bring individual claims against us if they believe that our terms and/or business practices are not in compliance with local consumer protection laws.

The attractiveness of our platform for Hosts and guests is impacted by a number of factors, including the willingness of individual Hosts to offer their homes on our platform, the willingness of guests to book stays at homes in lieu of more traditional options, such as hotels, our ability to continue to extend our operating model internationally and offer localized services that are desirable to our Hosts and guests, and our ability to offer cost-effective alternatives to traditional accommodations. Furthermore, both Hosts and guests may be reluctant or unwilling to use our platform because of concerns regarding their safety or the quality of their stays. Many Hosts and guests may be apprehensive about or not willing to share homes due to concerns surrounding the transmission of COVID-19, and if they are willing to share homes, their ability to do so may be restricted by laws, rules, regulations, or decrees adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",

In addition, when Hosts cancel reservations or if we fail to provide timely refunds to guests in connection with cancellations, guest perception of the value of our platform is adversely impacted and may cause guests to not use our platform in the future. The impact of these issues may be more pronounced if we are seen to have failed to provide prompt and appropriate community support or our platform policies are perceived to be too permissive, too restrictive, or providing Hosts and/or guests with unsatisfactory resolutions. We have been the subject of media reports, social media posts, blogs, and other forums that contain allegations about our business or activity on our platform that create negative publicity. As a result of these complaints and negative publicity, some Hosts have refrained from, and may in the future refrain from, listing with us, and some guests have refrained from, and may in the future refrain from, using our platform, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Such incidents have prompted, and may in the future prompt, stricter home sharing regulations or regulatory inquiries into our platform policies and business practices. In the United States and other countries, we have seen listings being used for parties in violation of Airbnb&#8217;s policies which have in some cases resulted in neighborhood disruption or violence.

These claims subject us to potentially significant liability and increase our operating costs and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have obtained some third-party insurance, which is subject to certain conditions and exclusions, for claims and losses incurred based on incidents related to bookings on our platform. Our third-party insurance, which may or may not be applicable to all claims, may be inadequate to fully cover alleged claims of liability, investigation costs, defense costs, and/or payouts.

      "We have taken and continue to take measures to improve the trust and safety on our platform, combat fraudulent activities and other misconduct and improve community trust, such as requiring identity and other information from Hosts and guests, attempting to confirm the location of listings, removing suspected fraudulent listings or listings repeatedly reported by guests to be significantly not as described, and removing Hosts and guests who fail to comply with our policies. These measures are long-term investments in our business and the trust and safety of our community. However, some of these measures increase friction on our platform by increasing the number of steps required to list or book, which reduces Host and guest activity on our platform, and could materially adversely affect our business. Implementing the trust and safety initiatives we have announced, which include limited verification of Hosts and listings, restrictions on &#8220;party&#8221; houses, restrictions on certain types of bookings, and our neighbor hotline, or other initiatives, has caused and will continue to cause us to incur significant ongoing expenses and may result in fewer listings and bookings or reduced Host and guest retention, which could also materially adversely affect our business. As we operate a global platform, the timing and implementation of these measures will vary across geographies. We have invested and plan to continue to invest significantly in the trust and safety of our platform, but there can be no assurances that these measures will be successful, significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on or off our platform, or be sufficient to protect our reputation in the event of such activity. \n",

      "Furthermore, we have established community standards, but those standards may not always be effectively enforced, communicated to, or consistently understood by all parts of our community. For example, while we require and communicate to Hosts and guests to make certain commitments with respect to diversity and belonging when they join Airbnb, these standards and requirements are not always well understood by all parts of our community. As a result, Hosts and guests may be surprised or disappointed when their expectations are not met. \n",

In particular, we rely on marketing to drive guest traffic to our platform. We have invested considerable resources into establishing and maintaining our brand. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we realigned our organizational priorities to further increase our focus on individual Hosts and brand marketing, while reducing performance marketing. \n",

The remainder of our traffic comes through direct or unpaid channels, which include brand marketing and search engine optimization (&#8220;SEO&#8221;). A critical factor in attracting Hosts and guests to our platform is how prominently listings are displayed in response to search queries for key search terms. The success of home sharing and our brand has led to increased costs for relevant keywords as our competitors competitively bid on our keywords, including our brand name. Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and \n",

If we are not able to effectively increase our traffic growth without increases in spend on performance marketing, we may need to increase our performance marketing spend in the future, including in response to increased spend on performance marketing from our competitors, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "The technology that powers much of our performance marketing is increasingly subject to strict regulation, and regulatory or legislative changes could adversely impact the effectiveness of our performance marketing efforts and, as a result, our business. For example, we rely on the placement and use of &#8220;cookies&#8221; &#8212; text files stored on a Host or guest&#8217;s web browser or device &#8212; and related and similar technologies to support tailored marketing to consumers. Many countries have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, regulations governing the use of cookies and similar technologies, and individuals may be required to &#8220;opt-in&#8221; to the placement of cookies used for purposes of marketing. For example, we are subject to evolving EU and United Kingdom privacy laws on cookies, tracking technologies, and e-marketing. In the European Union and United Kingdom under national laws derived from the ePrivacy Directive, informed consent is often required for the placement of a cookie or similar technology on a user&#8217;s device and for direct electronic marketing. The GDPR also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. The GDPR and similar laws also strictly regulate our use of personal data for marketing purposes. Additional legislation in this space is anticipated, which may increase the burden on our business and fines for non-compliance. While the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, recent European court and regulatory decisions as well as guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies, in particular in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem. We are seeing increased proactive enforcement activity in this area by European data regulators coupled with investigations flowing from complaints made by privacy activist groups. If the trend of increasing enforcement by regulators of the strict approach in recent guidance and decisions continues, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities. We could also face negative publicity or reputation damage as a result of regulatory action or from being named in complaints about our practices. Widespread adoption of regulations that significantly restrict our ability to use performance marketing technology could adversely affect our ability to market effectively to current and prospective Hosts and guests, and thus materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "We focus on unpaid channels such as SEO. SEO involves developing our platform in a way that enables a search engine to rank our platform prominently for search queries for which our platform&#8217;s content may be relevant. Changes to search engine algorithms or similar actions are not within our control, and could adversely affect our search-engine rankings and traffic to our platform. We believe that our SEO results have been adversely affected by the launch of Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, which reduce the prominence of our platform in organic search results for travel-related terms and placement on Google. To the extent that our brand and platform are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search results for any reason, we would need to increase our paid marketing spend which would increase our overall customer acquisition costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If Google or Apple uses its own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor its own or other preferred travel service offerings, or impose policies that effectively disallow us to continue our full product offerings in those channels, there could be an adverse effect on our ability to engage with Hosts and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search. \n",

      "Moreover, as guests increase their booking activity across multiple travel sites or compare offerings across sites, our marketing efficiency and effectiveness is adversely impacted, which could cause us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures in the future, which may not be offset by additional revenue, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, any negative publicity or public complaints, including those that impede our ability to maintain positive brand awareness through our marketing and consumer communications efforts, could harm our reputation and lead to fewer Hosts and guests using our platform, and attempts to replace this traffic through other channels will require us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures. \n",

      "For the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2021, we have elected to early adopt new accounting guidance that was recently released that simplifies the accounting for convertible debt that may be settled in cash. As a result, we recorded the 2026 Notes entirely as a liability on our balance sheet, net of issuance costs. Additionally, the new guidance modifies the treatment of convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash or shares by requiring the use of the &#8220;if-converted&#8221; method. Under that method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the 2026 Notes were converted solely into shares of Class A common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. In addition, in the future, we may, in our sole discretion, irrevocably elect to settle the conversion value of the 2026 Notes in cash up to the principal amount being converted. Following such an irrevocable election, if the conversion value of the 2026 Notes exceeds their principal amount for a reporting period, then we will calculate our diluted earnings per share by assuming that all of the 2026 Notes were converted at the beginning of the reporting period and that we issued shares of our Class A common stock to settle the excess, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share. \n",

      "Furthermore, if any of the conditions to the convertibility of the 2026 Notes are satisfied, then, under certain conditions, we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the 2026 Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, \n",

      "We have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates purchased shares of our Class A common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the 2026 Notes. \n",

For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes), then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their 2026 Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the 2026 Notes and the indenture governing the 2026 Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable. \n",

These factors, combined with sentiment of the workforce in China, and China&#8217;s policy towards foreign direct investment may particularly impact our operations in China. In addition, we need to ensure that our business practices in China are compliant with local laws and regulations, which may be interpreted and enforced in ways that are different from our interpretation, and/or create obligations on us that are costly to meet or conflict with laws in other jurisdictions and which may not be implemented within regulatory timelines. \n",

Failure to comply with such requests or other requirements as interpreted by government agencies may lead to impairment or disruption to our business and operations, including failing to obtain or losing the necessary licenses to operate in China, the blocking of our platform and services in China, and/or enforcement action against our Host community, corporate entities or officers. Our failure to comply with such requests or requirements, or conversely our compliance with such requests or requirements, could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, given that our headquarters is in the United States, any significant or prolonged deterioration in U.S.-China bilateral relations or escalation of geo-political risk in China could adversely affect our business. \n",

These impose additional requirements for certain categories of operators, and are continuing to develop and be clarified. At this point, it is uncertain what obligations will apply to us in the future, and we cannot predict what impact these new laws and regulations or the increased costs of compliance, if any, will have on our operations in China.

Under our contractual arrangements, we must rely on the VIE and the VIE equity holders to perform their obligations in order to exercise our control over the VIE. The VIE equity holders may have conflicts of interest with us or our stockholders, and they may not act in our best interests or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. If our VIE or its equity holders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may not be able to enforce our rights. In addition, if the Chinese government deems that the contractual arrangements in relation to our VIE do not comply with Chinese governmental restrictions on foreign investment, or if these regulations or their interpretation changes in the future, we could be subject to penalties, be forced to cease our operations in China, or be subject to restrictions in the future, and we may incur additional compliance costs. The contractual arrangements with our VIE may also be subject to scrutiny by the Chinese tax authorities and any adjustment of related party transaction pricing could lead to additional taxes. \n",

      "We track certain operational metrics, including metrics such as Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, active listings, active bookers, Hosts, and guest arrivals, which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools are subject to a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations globally. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV metrics are adjusted for cancellations and alterations that happen in the reporting period. However, cancellations and alterations for bookings made in the reporting period can occur beyond the current reporting period. This results in a reported amount of Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV in the quarter of the booking for which all of the bookings may ultimately not result in check-ins, and subsequently reduces our Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV metrics in subsequent quarters when we experience cancellations. Cancellations and alterations to previously booked trips increased dramatically after the COVID-19 outbreak, as guests were either unable to travel or uncomfortable traveling. If we experience high levels of cancellations in the future, our performance and related business metrics will be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "The calculation of Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings requires the ongoing collection of data on new offerings that are added to our platform over time. Our business is complex, and the methodology used to calculate Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings may require future adjustments to accurately represent the full value of new offerings. \n",

Further, any such fraudulent activity, along with associated refunds and cancellations, would reduce our metrics, in particular Nights and Experiences Booked, GBV, and active listings, in the quarter in which it is discovered. Limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operational metrics are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive these metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, our stock price could decline, we may be subject to stockholder litigation, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "Our new offerings and initiatives have a high degree of risk, as they may involve unproven businesses with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience. There can be no assurance that consumer demand for such offerings and initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, that we will be able to successfully manage the development and delivery of such offerings and initiatives, or that any of these offerings or initiatives will gain sufficient market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset associated expenses or liabilities. It is also possible that offerings developed by others will render our offerings and initiatives noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, these efforts entail investments in our systems and infrastructure, payments platform, and increased legal and regulatory compliance expenses, could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established offerings and geographies. Even if we are successful in developing new offerings and initiatives, regulatory authorities may subject us or our Hosts and guests to new rules, taxes, or restrictions or more aggressively enforce existing rules, taxes, or restrictions, that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully commercializing these initiatives. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, we may fail to grow and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "If we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to privacy and data protection, we may face potentially significant liability, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and increased regulation and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Privacy and data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex, and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, other processing, and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs or have other material adverse effects on our business. As part of Host and guest registration and business processes, we collect and use personal data, such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and identity verification information (for example, government issued identification or passport), as well as credit card or other financial information that Hosts and guests provide to us. The laws of many states and countries require businesses that maintain such personal data to implement reasonable measures to keep such information secure and otherwise restrict the ways in which such information can be collected and used. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, has resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies like ours. The GDPR regulates our collection, control, processing, sharing, disclosure, and other use of data that can directly or indirectly identify a living individual (&#8220;personal data&#8221;), and imposes stringent data protection requirements with significant penalties, and the risk of civil litigation, for noncompliance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. It may also lead to civil litigation, with the risks of damages or injunctive relief, or regulatory orders adversely impacting the ways in which our business can use personal data. Many large geographies in which we operate, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and India, have passed or are in the process of passing comparable or other robust data privacy legislation or regulation, which may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, from January 1, 2021 (when the transitional period following Brexit expired), we are subject to the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act of 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. Both regimes have the ability to fine up to the greater of 20 million Euros (17 million British Pounds) or 4% of global turnover, respectively. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how UK data \n",
      "\n",
      "protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. These changes will lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;). Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA and United Kingdom to the United States and other jurisdictions; for example, on July 16, 2020, the CJEU invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (&#8220;Privacy Shield&#8221;) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to US entities that had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it noted that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances; this has created uncertainty and increased the risk around our international operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the EEA, the Austrian and the French data protection authorities have indicated in recent ruling that use of Google Analytics by European website operators involves the unlawful transfer of personal data to the United States. A similar ruling was also recently handed down by the European Data Protection Supervisor in respect of the use of Google Analytics by the European Parliament. A number of other EU supervisory authorities are expected to take a similar approach, which may impact other business tools that we use. As the enforcement landscape further develops, and supervisory authorities issue further decisions and guidance on personal information export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, have to stop using certain tools and vendors and make other operational changes, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal information between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to other mechanisms (particularly standard contractual clauses), we previously relied on our own Privacy Shield certification and, in limited instances, the Privacy Shield certifications of third parties (for example, vendors and partners) for the purposes of transferring personal data from the EEA and United Kingdom to the United States. We continue to rely on the standard contractual clauses to transfer personal data outside the EEA and United Kingdom, including to the United States. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we rely on derogations provided for by law. These recent developments may require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and, or, receive personal data transfers to the United States and other jurisdictions. As our lead supervisory authorities (the Irish Data Protection Commission and the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection), the European Data Protection Board, and other data protection regulators issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, have to stop using certain tools and vendors and make operational changes, suffer complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services and our ability to provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the United States, federal law, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) and its implementing regulations, restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. The U.S. government, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. Numerous states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and processing of state residents&#8217; personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;) took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. The CCPA provides new and enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording consumers the right to access and delete their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. The law also prohibits covered businesses from discriminating against consumers (for example, charging more for services) for exercising any of their CCPA rights. The CCPA imposes severe statutory damages as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action is expected to increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. It remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;). The CPRA further expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements that may impact our business, and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements. The CPRA and the CCPA may lead other states to pass comparable legislation, with potentially greater penalties, and more rigorous compliance requirements relevant to our business. The effects of the CPRA, the CCPA, and other similar state or federal laws, are significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such legislation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Various other governments and consumer agencies around the world have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices and many have enacted different and often contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically. Compliance with numerous and contradictory requirements of different jurisdictions is particularly difficult and costly for an online business such as ours, which collects personal information from Hosts, guests, and other individuals in multiple jurisdictions. If any jurisdiction in which we operate adopts news laws or changes its interpretation of its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or localization such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we could risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources to comply with GDPR, GLBA, CCPA, and other privacy regulations around the world, many of these regulations expose us to the possibility of material penalties, significant legal liability, changes in how we operate or offer our products, and interruptions or cessation of our ability to operate in key geographies, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, to improve the trust and safety on our platform, we conduct certain verification procedures aimed at our Hosts, guests, and listings in certain jurisdictions. Such verification procedures may include utilizing public information on the Internet, accessing public databases such as court records, utilizing third-party vendors to analyze Host or guest data, or physical inspection. These types of activities may expose us to the risk of regulatory enforcement from privacy regulators and civil litigation. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including tax authorities, state and city regulators, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence agencies, our Hosts, guests, and privacy regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, and laws, which could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions. Conversely, if we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement on the interpretation of the law, we are likely to face enforcement action from such government, engage in litigation, face increased regulatory scrutiny, and experience an adverse impact on our relationship with governments or our ability to offer our services within certain jurisdictions. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our business also increasingly relies on machine learning, artificial intelligence and automated decision making to improve our services and tailor our interactions with our customers. However, in recent years use of these methods has come under increased regulatory scrutiny. New laws, guidance and/or decisions in this area may limit our ability to use our machine learning and artificial intelligence, or require us to make changes to our platform or operations that may decrease our operational efficiency, result in an increase to operating costs and/or hinder our ability to improve our services. For example, there are specific rules on the use of automated decision making under the GDPR that require the existence of automated decision making to be disclosed to the data subject with a meaningful explanation of the logic used in such decision making in certain circumstances, and safeguards must be implemented to safeguard individual rights, including the right to obtain human intervention and to contest any decision. Further, California recently introduced a law requiring disclosure of chatbot functionality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with consumer protection, privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations; policies; or enforcement notices and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit) could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, government agencies, or others. We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, and diversion of internal resources. We could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages or fines or be required to make changes to our business. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant negative publicity, and an erosion of trust. If any of these events were to occur, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we fail to prevent data security breaches, there may be damage to our brand and reputation, material financial penalties, and legal liability, along with a decline in use of our platform, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are risks of security breaches both on and off our systems as we increase the types of technology we use to operate our platform, including mobile apps and third-party payment processing providers, and as we collaborate with third parties that may need to process our Host or guest data or have access to our infrastructure. The evolution of technology systems introduces ever more complex security risks that are difficult to predict and defend against. Further, there has been a surge in widespread cyber-attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the frequency and scope of cyber-attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated data security risks. An increasing number of companies, including those with significant online operations, have recently disclosed breaches of their security, some of which involved sophisticated tactics and techniques allegedly attributable to criminal enterprises or nation-state actors. While we take significant measures to guard against the type of activity that can lead to data breaches, the techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are unknown until launched against a target. As such, we may be unable to anticipate these tactics and techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, with a large geographically disparate employee base, we are not immune from the possibility of a malicious insider compromising our information systems and infrastructure. This risk has grown in light of the greater adoption of remote work as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also have a distributed community support organization including third-party providers that have access to personal information. We and other companies in our industry have dealt with incidents involving such insiders exfiltrating the personal data of customers, stealing corporate trade secrets and key financial metrics, and illegally diverting funds. No series of measures can fully safeguard against a sufficiently determined and skilled insider threat. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, bad actors have targeted and will continue to target our Hosts and guests directly with attempts to breach the security of their email accounts or management systems, such as through phishing attacks where a third party attempts to infiltrate our systems or acquire information by posing as a legitimate inquiry or electronic communication, which are fraudulent identity theft schemes designed to appear as legitimate emails from us or from our Hosts or guests, partners, or vendors. We have seen many instances of our Hosts and guests falling prey to such schemes, which result in their accounts being taken over by fraudsters intent on perpetrating fraud against them, other users, and our platform. Bad actors may also employ other schemes aimed at defrauding our Hosts or guests in ways that we may not anticipate or be able to adequately guard against. Even if phishing and spamming attacks and other fraud schemes are not carried out through our systems, victims may nevertheless seek recovery from us. Because of our prominence, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific scheme or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of our offerings, services, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our Hosts and guests may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing Hosts and guests and attract new Hosts and guests. The ability of fraudsters to directly target our Hosts and guests with fraudulent communications, or cause an account takeover, exposes us to significant financial fraud risk, including costly litigation, which is difficult to fully mitigate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, our practice is to encrypt certain sensitive data when it is in transit and at rest. However, advances in computer capabilities, increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in our failure or inability to adequately protect sensitive data. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic intrusions that our security measures may not detect. We have experienced security incidents in the past, and we may face additional attempted security intrusions in the future. Any circumvention of our security measures could result in the misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, interrupt our operations, result in financial loss, damage our computers or those of our Hosts and guests, or otherwise cause damage to our reputation and business. Further, the ability to bypass our information security controls could degrade our trust and safety programs, which could expose individuals to a risk of physical harm or violence. \n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that certain personal data has been exfiltrated, accessed, or used inappropriately, we may need to inform the Host or guest whose data was stolen, accessed, or used, and may be subject to significant fines and penalties. Further, under certain regulatory schemes, such as the CCPA, we may be liable for statutory damages on a per breached record basis, irrespective of any actual damages or harm to the individual. This means that in the event of a breach we could face government scrutiny or consumer class actions alleging statutory damages amounting to hundreds of millions, and possibly billions of dollars. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on third-party service providers, including financial institutions, to process some of our data and that of our Hosts and guests, including payment information, and any failure by such third parties to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or disclosure of, such information could have adverse consequences for us similar to an incident directly on our systems. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have acquired and will continue to acquire companies that are vulnerable to security breaches, and we are responsible for any security breaches of these newly acquired companies. While we conduct due diligence of these companies, we do not have access to the full operating history of the companies and cannot be certain there have not been security breaches prior to our acquisition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We expend, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources to protect against security related incidents and address problems caused by such incidents. Even if we were to expend more resources, regulators and complainants may not deem our efforts sufficient, and regardless of the expenditure, the risk of security related incidents cannot be fully mitigated. We have a heightened risk of security breaches due to some of our operations being located in certain international jurisdictions. Any actual or alleged security breaches or alleged violations of federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations relating to privacy and data security could result in mandated user notifications, litigation, government investigations, significant fines, and expenditures; divert management&#8217;s attention from operations; deter people from using our platform; damage our brand and reputation; force us to cease operations for some length of time; and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Defending against claims or litigation based on any security breach or incident, regardless of their merit, will be costly and may cause reputation harm. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, denial of coverage as to any specific claim, or any change or cessation in our insurance policies and coverages, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and software, including algorithms that incorporate machine learning and exhibit characteristics of artificial intelligence. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform, to effectively implement updates to our systems and to appropriately monitor and maintain our systems. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code have not been and may not be discovered until after the code has been released. We have, from time to time, found defects or errors in our system and software limitations that have resulted in, and may discover additional issues in the future that could result in, platform unavailability or system disruption, or the inability of our systems to implement timely updates that are required for regulatory compliance. For example, defects or errors have resulted in and could result in the delay in making payments to Hosts or overpaying or underpaying Hosts, which would impact our cash position and may cause Hosts to lose trust in our payment operations. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems released to production or found in third-party software, including open source software, that is incorporated into our code, any misconfigurations of our systems, or any unintended interactions between systems could result in poor system performance, an interruption in the availability of our platform, incorrect payments, search ranking problems, Host account takeovers, fraudulent listings, issues with chatbot behavior, inadvertent failure to effectively comply with legal or regulatory requirements, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of existing and potential Hosts and guests, loss of revenue, liability for damages, a failure to comply with certain legal or tax reporting obligations, and regulatory inquiries or other proceedings, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Since our founding, we have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our platform. If our systems and network infrastructure cannot be expanded or are not scaled to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, decreased customer satisfaction, and delays in the introduction of new offerings and tiers.

      "addition, Northern California has recently experienced, and may continue to experience power outages during the fire season and our headquarters does not have power generator backup to maintain full business continuity. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our headquarters, any third-party cloud hosting facilities, or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and result in lengthy interruptions or delays of our platform and services. \n",

      "Our systems and operations are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorism, and similar misconduct from external sources and malicious insiders. Our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing attacks on our systems, and any such attack could cause significant interruptions in our operations. For instance, from time to time, we have experienced denial-of-service type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our platform slow or unavailable for periods of time. There are numerous other potential forms of attack, such as phishing, account takeovers, malicious code injections, ransomware, and the attempted use of our platform to launch a denial-of-service attack against another party, each of which could cause significant interruptions in our operations or involve us in legal or regulatory proceedings. Reductions in the availability and response time of our online platform could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such attack on our systems and measures we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customers. These issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and the variety of services we offer, and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced and available. Successful attacks could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation, and could prevent consumers from booking or visiting our platform during the attack, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "In the event of certain system failures, we may not be able to switch to back-up systems immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged. We have experienced system failures from time to time. In addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a significant amount of consumer questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our community support team. Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate and significant loss of revenue, an increase in community support costs, and harm our reputation, and could result in some consumers switching to our competitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system failures, our brand and reputation could be permanently and significantly harmed, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. While we have taken and continue to take steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems, these steps are expensive and may not be completely effective in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur. \n",

      "We use both internally developed systems and third-party systems to operate our platform, including transaction and payment processing, and financial and accounting systems. If the number of consumers using our platform increases substantially, or if critical third-party systems stop operating as designed, we may need to significantly upgrade, expand, or repair our transaction and payment processing systems, financial and accounting systems, and other infrastructure. We may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner, and depending on the systems affected, our transaction and payment processing, and financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our Hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage Hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the United States (federal, state, and local) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We have received communications from numerous foreign, federal, state, and local governments regarding the application of tax laws or regulations to our business or demanding data about our Hosts and guests to aid in threatened or actual enforcement actions against our Hosts and guests. In many jurisdictions where applicable, we have agreed to collect and remit taxes on behalf of our Hosts. We have been subject to complaints by, and are involved in a number of lawsuits brought by, certain government entities for alleged responsibility for direct and indirect taxes. In some jurisdictions we are in dispute with respect to past and future taxes. A number of jurisdictions have proposed or implemented new tax laws or interpreted existing laws to explicitly apply various taxes to businesses like ours. Laws and regulations relating to taxes as applied to our platform, and to our Hosts and guests, vary greatly among jurisdictions, and it is difficult or impossible to predict how such laws and regulations will be applied. \n",
      "\n",
      "The application of indirect taxes, such as lodging taxes, hotel, sales and use tax, privilege taxes, excise taxes, VAT, goods and services tax, harmonized sales taxes, business tax, and gross receipt taxes (together, &#8220;indirect taxes&#8221;) to e-commerce activities such as ours and to our Hosts or guests is a complex and evolving issue. Some of such tax laws or regulations hold us responsible for the reporting, collection, and payment of such taxes, and such laws could be applied to us for transactions conducted in the past as well as transactions in the future. Many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. New or revised foreign, federal, state, or local tax regulations may subject us or our Hosts and guests to additional indirect, income, and other taxes, and depending upon the jurisdiction could subject us or our Hosts and guests to significant monetary penalties and fines for non-payment of taxes. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering adopting or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including digital platform revenue-based taxes, targeting online sharing platforms and online marketplaces, and new obligations to collect Host income taxes, sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on digital platforms. We may recognize additional tax expenses and be subject to additional tax liabilities, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by additional taxes of this nature or additional taxes or penalties resulting from our failure to comply with any reporting, collection, and payment obligations. We accrue a reserve for such taxes when the likelihood is probable that such taxes apply to us, and upon examination or audit, such reserves may be insufficient. \n",
      "\n",
      "New or revised taxes and, in particular, the taxes described above and similar taxes would likely increase the price paid by guests, the cost of doing business for our Hosts, discourage Hosts and guests from using our platform, and lead to a decline in revenue, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies for tax reporting purposes, our Hosts, guests, and regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, and laws and commence proceedings or actions against us. If we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement on the interpretation of the law, we are likely to face enforcement action, engage in litigation, face increased regulatory scrutiny, and experience an adverse impact in our relationships with governments. Our competitors may arrive at different or novel solutions to the application of taxes to analogous businesses that could cause our Hosts and guests to leave our platform in favor of conducting business on the platforms of our competitors. This uncertainty around the application of taxes and the impact of those taxes on the actual or perceived value of our platform may also cause guests to use OTAs, hotels, or other traditional travel services. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We devote significant resources, including management time, to the application and interpretation of laws and working with various jurisdictions to clarify whether taxes are applicable and the amount of taxes that apply. The application of indirect taxes to our Hosts, guests, and our platform significantly increases our operational expenses as we build the infrastructure and tools to capture data and to report, collect, and remit taxes. Even if we are able to build the required infrastructure and tools, we may not be able to complete them in a timely fashion, in particular given the speed at which regulations and their interpretations can change, which could harm our relationship with governments and our reputation, and result in enforcement actions and litigation. The lack of uniformity in the laws and regulations relating to indirect taxes as applied to our platform and to our Hosts and guests further increases the operational and financial complexity of our systems and processes, and introduces potential for errors or incorrect tax calculations, all of which are costly to our business and results of operations. Certain regulations may be so complex as to make it infeasible for us to be fully compliant. As our business operations expand or change, including as a result of introducing new or enhanced offerings, tiers or features, or due to acquisitions, the application of indirect taxes to our business and to our Hosts and guests will further change and evolve, and could further increase our liability for taxes, discourage Hosts and guests from using our platform, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

We, including through our Hosts, operate in certain areas where the risk of natural or climate-related disaster or other catastrophic losses exists, and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us, our Hosts&#8217; property or the surrounding area. For example, to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns or an increase in extreme weather events, our coastal destinations could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels causing damage to our Hosts&#8217; properties and result in a reduced number of listings in these areas. Climate change may also affect our business by increasing the cost of, or making unavailable, property insurance on terms our Hosts find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs for our Hosts, including the cost of water or energy, and requiring our Hosts to expend funds as they seek to repair and protect their properties in connection with such events. As a result of the foregoing and other climate-related issues, our Hosts may decide to remove their listings from our platform.

We recognize revenue upon the completion of a check-in. As our business matures, other seasonal trends may develop, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme.

Meeting the community support expectations of our Hosts and guests requires significant time and resources from our community support team and significant investment in staffing, technology, including automation and machine learning to improve efficiency, infrastructure, policies, and community support tools. The failure to develop the appropriate technology, infrastructure, policies, and community support tools, or to manage or properly train our community support team, could compromise our ability to resolve questions and complaints quickly and effectively. The number of our Hosts and guests has grown significantly and such growth, as well as any future growth, will put additional pressure on our community support organization and our technology organization. In addition, as we service a global customer base and continue to grow outside of North America and Europe, we need to be able to provide effective support that meets our Hosts&#8217; and guests&#8217; needs and languages globally at scale. As part of our reduction in force announced in May 2020, we significantly reduced the number of employees in our community support organization and our technology organization, which impacted our ability to provide effective support to our Hosts and guests. Our service is staffed based on complex algorithms that map to our business forecasts. Any volatility in those forecasts could lead to staffing gaps that could impact the quality of our service.

We may make payouts for property damage claims under our Host Damage Protection program, which we account for as consideration paid to a customer and is also generally treated as a reduction in revenue. A robust community support effort is costly, and we expect such cost to continue to rise in the future as we grow our business. We have historically seen a significant number of community support inquiries from Hosts and guests. Our efforts to reduce the number of community support requests may not be effective, and we could incur increased costs without corresponding revenue, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "A significant portion of our business is denominated and transacted in foreign currencies, which subjects us to foreign exchange risk. We offer integrated payments to our Hosts and guests in over 40 currencies. Generally speaking, U.S. dollar strength adversely impacts the translation of the portion of our revenue that is generated in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 50% of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our results of operations could also be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar as a large portion of our costs are U.S. dollar-denominated. We also have foreign exchange risk with respect to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of Hosts and guests, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, and our financial results are affected by the remeasurement and translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars, which is reflected in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Furthermore, our platform generally enables guests to make payments in the currency of their choice to the extent that the currency is supported by Airbnb, which may not match the currency in which the Host elects to get paid. In those cases, we bear the currency risk of both the guest payment as well as the Host payment due to timing differences in such payments. We may also risk currency rate and logic confusion by Hosts or guests if they do not understand the currency shown. While we have and may choose to enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure in the future, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate exposure. \n",

Additionally, for our equity investments in private companies where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, we record our proportionate share of net income or loss in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. The financial statements provided by these companies are often unaudited. Our investments in private companies are inherently risky, including early-stage companies with limited cash to support their operations and companies whose results are negatively impacted by downturns in the travel industry, such as the one in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The companies in which we invest include early-stage companies that may still be developing products and services with limited cash to support the development, marketing and sales of their products. Further, our ability to liquidate such investments is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition, as no public market currently exists for the securities held in the investees. Valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of a liquid market for the securities of such companies. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value, we will recognize an expense to adjust the carrying value to its estimated fair value. Negative changes in the estimated fair value of private companies in which we invest could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

The tax laws applicable to our business, including those of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Airbnb. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

We are currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) for the years 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018. We are continuing to respond to inquiries related to these examinations. In December 2020, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (&#8220;NOPA&#8221;) from the IRS for the 2013 tax year relating to the valuation of our international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. The notice proposed an increase to our U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of $1.3 billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $1.0 billion. We disagree with the proposed adjustment and intend to vigorously contest it. In February 2021, we submitted a protest to the IRS describing our disagreement with the proposed agreement and requesting the case to be transferred to IRS Independent Office of Appeals (&#8220;IRS Appeals&#8221;). In December 2021, we received a rebuttal from the IRS with the same proposed adjustments that were in the NOPA. We will continue to pursue all available remedies to resolve this dispute, which include: entering into administrative settlement discussions with the IRS Appeals in 2022, and if necessary petitioning the U.S. Tax Court (&#8220;Tax Court&#8221;) for redetermination if an acceptable outcome cannot be reached with IRS Appeals, and finally, and if necessary, appealing the Tax Court&#8217;s decision to the appropriate appellate court. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position and such tax and related interest and penalties, if any, exceeds our current reserves, such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations, and any assessment of additional tax could require a significant cash payment and have a material adverse impact on our cash flow. \n",

      "In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed a restructuring plan to repatriate our intellectual property to the United States to align with our evolving operations in a post COVID-19 environment. The restructuring plan involved numerous intercompany arrangements and tax jurisdictions and required the valuation of multiple intercompany transactions which could be challenged by respective tax authorities, including as a result of reduced valuations caused by forecast adjustments due to the impact of COVID-19, and any adverse outcome of any review or audit could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "The determination of our worldwide provision for (benefit from) income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future tax expense could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. For example, we have previously incurred losses in the United States and certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the United States and this could continue to happen in the future. We may also be subject to additional tax liability relating to indirect or other non-income taxes, as described in our risk factor titled &#8220;&#8212; Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our Hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage Hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform.&#8221; Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

      "In addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that have differing licenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm&#8217;s-length or that are potentially less tax efficient than our licenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act contains certain tax provisions, including provisions that retroactively and/or temporarily suspend or relax in certain respects the application of certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, such as limitations on the deduction of net operating losses and interest. The United States government may enact further significant changes to the taxation of business entities including, among others, an increase in the corporate income tax rate, the imposition of minimum taxes or surtaxes on certain types of income or significant changes to the taxation of income derived from international operations. The likelihood of these changes being enacted or implemented is unclear. In addition, many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and states, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries and states where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. For example, in Italy, a 2017 law requires short-term rental platforms that process payments to collect and remit Host income tax and tourist tax, amongst other obligations. Airbnb has challenged this law before the Italian courts but if we are unsuccessful this will lead to further compliance and potentially significant prior and future tax obligations. \n",

      "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and issued a report in 2015 and an interim report in 2018, and in 2021, more than 140 countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income (including indirect) taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, among others, have each proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which includes business activities on digital platforms and would likely apply to our business. \n",

These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations. Due to the large and increasing scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above and in our risk factor titled &#8220;&#8212; Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our Hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage Hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform&#8221; could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income (including indirect) taxes imposed on our business, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

      "While federal net operating loss carryforwards generated on or after January 1, 2018 are not subject to expiration, the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforwards is limited to 80% of our taxable income for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future taxable income, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation&#8217;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change taxable income or income tax liabilities may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable income or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us. \n",

      "Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management and employees. Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk founded our company and have been instrumental in devising and implementing our strategies for growth and scaling our business. Our founders and other members of our senior management team, as well as other employees, may terminate their employment with us at any time, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "As we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel we need. Our business requires highly skilled technical, engineering, design, product, data analytics, marketing, business development, and community support personnel, including executive-level employees, who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. Competition for qualified employees and executive-level employees is intense in our industry and particularly in San Francisco where we have our headquarters and other jurisdictions where we operate. This competition has become exacerbated by the increase in employee resignations currently taking place throughout the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is commonly referred to as the &#8220;great resignation.&#8221; We may also experience employee turnover as a result of the ongoing &#8220;great resignations.&#8221; The loss of qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate employees required for the planned expansion of our business would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition and impair our ability to grow. \n",
      "\n",
      "To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our programs or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past. We have a number of current employees, including our founders, who hold equity in our company or whose equity awards are or became substantially vested upon the completion of our initial public offering. As a result, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate these employees, and the value of their holdings could affect their decisions about whether or not they continue to work for us. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may be adversely affected by declines in our stock price. If we issue significant equity to attract employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional stock-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. \n",

      "\n",
      "People regularly access the Internet through mobile phones, tablets, handheld computers, voice-assisted speakers, television set-top devices, smart televisions, wearables, and automobile in-dash systems. These devices enable new modalities of interaction, such as conversational user interfaces, and new intermediaries, such as &#8220;super-apps&#8221; like WeChat, where consumers can use many online services without leaving a particular app. We anticipate that the use of these means of access will continue to grow and that usage through desktop computers will continue to decline, especially in certain regions of the world experiencing the highest rate of Internet adoption. The functionality and user experiences associated with these alternative devices, such as a smaller screen size or lack of a screen, may make the use of our platform through such devices more difficult than through a desktop computer, lower the use of our platform, and make it more difficult for our Hosts to upload content to our platform. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns can differ on alternative devices, and it is uncertain how the proliferation of mobile devices will impact the use of our platform and services. Mobile consumers may also be unwilling to download multiple apps from multiple companies providing similar services meaning that such consumers may opt to use one of our competitors&#8217; services instead of ours. As a result, brand recognition and the consumer experience with our mobile app will likely become increasingly important to our business. In addition, these new modalities create opportunities for device or systems companies, such as Amazon, Apple, and Google, to control the interaction with our consumers and disintermediate existing platforms such as ours. \n",
      "\n",
      "We need to provide solutions for consumers who are limited in the size of the app they can support on their mobile devices and address latency issues in countries with lower bandwidth for both desktop and mobile devices. Because our platform contains data-intensive media, these issues are exacerbated. As new devices, operating systems, and platforms continue to be released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our offerings and features to them, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of our offerings and features. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our success will also depend on the interoperability of our offerings with a range of third-party technologies, systems, networks, operating systems, and standards, including iOS and Android; the availability of our mobile apps in app stores and in &#8220;super-app&#8221; environments; and the creation, maintenance, and development of relationships with key participants in related industries, some of which may also be our competitors. In addition, if accessibility of various apps is limited by executive order or other government actions, the full functionality of devices may not be available to our customers. Moreover, third-party platforms, services and offerings are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with those of third parties. If we lose such interoperability, we experience difficulties or increased costs in integrating our offerings into alternative devices or systems, or manufacturers or operating systems elect not to include our offerings, make changes that degrade the functionality of our offerings, or give preferential treatment to competitive products, the growth of our community and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. This risk may be exacerbated by the frequency with which consumers change or upgrade their devices. In the event consumers choose devices that do not already include or support our platform or do not install our mobile apps when they change or upgrade their devices, our traffic and Host and guest engagement may be harmed. \n",

      "The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, consolidation, frequent new offering announcements, introductions, and enhancements, and changing consumer demands and preferences. We have invested heavily in our technology in recent years. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt our platform and services to evolving industry standards and local preferences and to continually innovate and improve the performance, features, and reliability of our platform and services in response to competitive offerings and the evolving demands of Hosts and guests. Our future success will also depend on our ability to adapt to emerging technologies such as tokenization, cryptocurrencies, new authentication technologies, such as biometrics, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and cloud technologies. As a result, we intend to continue to spend significant resources maintaining, developing, and enhancing our technologies and platform; however, these efforts may be more costly than expected and may not be successful. For example, we may not make the appropriate investments in new technologies, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, technological innovation often results in unintended consequences such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and other system failures. Any such bug, vulnerability, or failure, especially in connection with a significant technical implementation or change, could result in lost business, harm to our brand or reputation, consumer complaints, and other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another critical component to our future success will be our ability to integrate new or emerging payment methods into our platform to offer alternative payment solutions to consumers. Alternate payment providers such as Alipay, Paytm, and WeChat Pay operate closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both consumers and merchants. In many regions, particularly in Asia where credit cards are not readily available and/or e-commerce is largely carried out through mobile devices, these and other emerging alternate payment methods are the exclusive or preferred means of payment for many consumers. \n",

      "We process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis. When Hosts do not fulfill their obligations to guests, there are fictitious listings or fraudulent bookings on our platform, or there are Host account takeovers, we have incurred and will continue to incur losses from claims by Hosts and guests, and these losses may be substantial. Such instances have and can lead to the reversal of payments received by us for such bookings, referred to as a &#8220;chargeback.&#8221; For the year ended December 31, 2021, total chargeback expense was $83.8 million. Our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes, which have become increasingly common and sophisticated, could be adversely impacted by the adoption of new payment methods, the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms, including mobile and other devices, and our growth in certain regions, including in regions with a history of elevated fraudulent activity. We expect that technically-knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent our anti-fraud systems. In addition, the payment card networks have rules around acceptable chargeback ratios. If we are unable to effectively combat fictitious listings and fraudulent bookings on our platform, combat the use of fraudulent or stolen credit cards, or otherwise maintain or lower our current levels of charge-backs, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or be unable to continue to accept card payments because payment card networks have revoked our access to their networks, any of which would materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our payments platform is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses, including money laundering, transactions in violation of economic and trade sanctions, corruption and bribery, terrorist financing, fraudulent listings, Host account takeovers, or the facilitation of other illegal activity. Use of our payments platform for illegal or improper uses has subjected us, and may subject us in the future, to claims, lawsuits, and government and regulatory investigations, inquiries, or requests, which could result in liability and reputational harm for us. We have taken measures to detect and reduce fraud and illegal activities, but these measures need to be continually improved and may add friction to our booking process. These measures may also not be effective against fraud and illegal activities, particularly new and continually evolving forms of circumvention. If these measures do not succeed in reducing fraud, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

As we expand and localize our international activities, we have and will become increasingly subject to the laws of additional countries or geographies. In addition, because we facilitate bookings on our platform worldwide, one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws. Laws regulating our payments platform outside of the United States often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations on us, as well as broader liability. For example, certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) or U.S. anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing regulations. \n",

As a result of findings from these assessments, we have, are, and may in the future take certain actions, such as implementing enhancements to our compliance measures and amending, updating, or revising our policies, procedures, and internal controls, and other operational frameworks, designed to monitor for and ensure compliance with existing and new laws, rules, regulations, policies, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance. Implementing appropriate measures to fully remediate or address findings from assessments of our compliance programs may require us to incur significant costs. \n",

      "Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations, including the ones described in this risk factor, or orders of any governmental authority, including changes to or expansion of their interpretations, may subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, result in additional compliance and licensure requirements, and increased regulatory scrutiny of our business. In addition, we may be forced to restrict or change our operations or business practices, make product changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. The complexity of global regulatory and enforcement regimes, coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment, could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions, and have an adverse impact on, or result in the termination of, our relationships with financial institutions and other service providers on whom we rely for payment processing services. Our ability to track and verify transactions to comply with these regulations, including the ones described in this risk factor, require a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and regulations change, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls.

These requirements will be enforced in the United Kingdom with respect to online card payments starting on March 14, 2022, while countries in the EEA began enforcing these requirements in 2021. In many cases, strong customer authentication requires our UK and EEA guests to engage in additional steps to authenticate payment transactions and UK and EEA Hosts to perform authentication upon access to their Airbnb payout account or modification of their payout account information. These additional authentication requirements may make our platform experience for Hosts and guests in the UK And EEA substantially less \n",

We are subject to a number of such federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations, as well as related state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E as implemented by the CFPB. Money transmitters such as Airbnb Payments are subject to direct supervision and periodic examination by the CFPB and are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer, among other requirements.

The CFPB&#8217;s authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties, including plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys&#8217; fees. The Dodd-Frank Act also empowers state attorneys general and other state officials to enforce federal consumer protection laws under specified conditions. Various government offices and agencies, including various state agencies and state attorneys general (as well as the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Justice), have the authority to conduct reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) involving us or our subsidiaries. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings could result in, among other things, substantial fines, penalties or changes in business practices that may require us to incur substantial costs. \n",

      "We provide payment services that may be subject to various U.S. state and federal privacy laws and regulations. Relevant federal privacy laws include the GLBA, which (along with its implementing regulations) restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. See our risk factor titled &#8220;&#8212; If we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to privacy and data protection, we may face potentially significant liability, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and increased regulation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.&#8221; \n",

      "We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world, including the BSA. Among other things, the BSA requires money services businesses (including money transmitters such as Airbnb Payments) to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records. The BSA prohibits, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. In connection with and when required by regulatory requirements, we make information available to certain U.S. federal and state, as well as certain foreign, government agencies to assist in the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations. In certain circumstances, we may be required by government agencies to deny transactions that may be related to persons suspected of money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activities, and it is possible that we may inadvertently deny transactions from customers who are making legal money transfers. Regulators in the United States and globally may require us to \n",

In the European Union, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (&#8220;MLD4&#8221;) may make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Penalties for non-compliance with MLD4 could include fines of up to 10% of APUK&#8217;s or APLux&#8217;s total annual turnover. In April 2018, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission&#8217;s proposal for a Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (&#8220;MLD5&#8221;), containing more stringent provisions in certain areas, which will increase compliance costs. \n",

      "We are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by governments where we operate, including the U.S. government (including without limitation regulations administered and enforced by OFAC and the U.S. Department of State), the Council of the European Union, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation of Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury in the United Kingdom (&#8220;OFSI&#8221;) and the Ministry of Finance and Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier of Luxembourg. These economic and trade sanctions prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with certain specified countries, regions, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated, such as individuals and entities included on OFAC&#8217;s List of Specially Designated Nationals (&#8220;SDN List&#8221;), subject to EU/UK asset freezes, or other sanctions measures. Any future economic and trade sanctions imposed in jurisdictions where we have significant business could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our ability to track and verify transactions and otherwise to comply with these regulations require a high level of internal controls. We maintain policies and procedures to implement these internal controls, which we periodically assess and update to the extent we identify compliance gaps. We routinely report to OFAC on payments we have rejected or blocked pursuant to OFAC sanctions regulations and on any possible violations of those regulations. We have also reported to OFSI on dealings with persons subject to EU/UK sanctions. There is a risk that, despite the internal controls that we have in place, we have engaged in transactions inconsistent with applicable sanctions laws. Any non-compliance with economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations or related investigations could result in claims or actions against us and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As our business continues to grow and regulations change, we may be required to make additional investments in our internal controls or modify our business. \n",

      "Beginning in July 2019, we conducted an internal review and have been holding related discussions with OFAC regarding certain user activity on our platform that may have been inconsistent with our policies and the requirements of U.S. sanctions laws. The scope of this review included activity by users in certain countries and territories that were or are the target of U.S. sanctions laws. In July 2020, OFAC issued to us a cautionary letter and no administrative penalty with respect to certain aspects of that review concerning the Crimea region of Ukraine. The internal review also covered certain other issues concerning our compliance with OFAC&#8217;s sanctions program, focusing in particular on our business in Cuba, and as to our compliance with restrictions on transactions with specially designated nationals. We submitted the results of that internal review in final Voluntary Self Disclosures to OFAC in September 2020. In October 2020, OFAC issued to us cautionary letters and a no action letter, and no administrative penalties, with respect to the disclosed matters involving specially designated nationals. In December 2021, OFAC closed its review of aspects of our Cuba business following our execution of a settlement agreement in which we agreed to (i) pay $91.2 thousand and (ii) affirmative ongoing compliance commitments, in connection with transactions that we voluntarily disclosed that OFAC deemed to be apparent violations of its Cuba sanctions regulations. If we fail to meet these compliance commitments, we could be subject to OFAC reopening the review in relation to the matters covered by our settlement agreement. \n",

      "\n",
      "The loss of our credit and debit card acceptance privileges or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain card acceptance privileges would significantly limit our business model since a vast majority of our guests pay using credit or debit cards. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (the &#8220;PCI DSS&#8221;). Under the PCI DSS, we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use, storage, and transmission of card data to help prevent credit card fraud. If we fail to comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, including the PCI DSS, we would be in breach of our contractual obligations to payment processors and merchant banks. Such failure to comply may damage our relationship with payment card networks, subject us to restrictions, fines, penalties, damages, and civil liability, and could eventually prevent us from processing or accepting payment cards, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to comply with, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to make their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. Further, there is no guarantee that, even if we comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, we will be able to maintain our payment card acceptance privileges. We also cannot guarantee that our compliance with network rules or the PCI DSS will prevent illegal or improper use of our payments platform or the theft, loss, or misuse of the credit card data of customers or participants, or a security breach. We are also required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, and other assessments of our compliance with the PCI DSS. If an audit, self-assessment, or other assessment indicates that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time-consuming remediation efforts, and we could lose our payment card acceptance privileges. \n",

      "We are also subject to network operating rules and guidelines promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (&#8220;NACHA&#8221;) relating to payment transactions we process using the Automated Clearing House (&#8220;ACH&#8221;) Network. Like the payment networks, NACHA may update its operating rules and guidelines at any time, which can require us to take more costly compliance measures or to develop more complex monitoring systems. \n",

      "We rely on third-party payment service providers to process payments made by guests and payments made to Hosts on our platform. If these third-party payment service providers become unavailable or we are subject to increased fees, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "We rely on a number of third-party payment service providers, including payment card networks, banks, payment processors, and payment gateways, to link us to payment card and bank clearing networks to process payments made by our guests and to remit payments to Hosts on our platform. We have agreements with these providers, some of whom are the sole providers of their particular service. \n",
      "\n",
      "If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted, we would need to find an alternate payment service provider, and we may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment service provider in an acceptable time frame. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by our Hosts and guests. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant losses and, in certain cases, require us to make payments to Hosts out of our funds, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the software and services provided by our third-party payment service providers may fail to meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised, or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely payments to Hosts on our platform, which could make our platform less convenient and desirable to customers and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain Hosts and guests. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, our agreements with payment service providers may allow these companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our cash as a reserve. They may be entitled to a reserve or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in our business, results of operations, and financial condition. An imposition of a reserve or suspension of processing services by one or more of our processing companies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "If we fail to invest adequate resources into the payment processing infrastructure on our platform, or if our investment efforts are unsuccessful or unreliable, our payments activities may not function properly or keep pace with competitive offerings, which could adversely impact their usage. Further, our ability to expand our payments activities into additional countries is dependent upon the third-party providers we use to support these activities. As we expand the availability of our payments activities to additional geographies or offer new payment methods to our Hosts and guests in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements, and exposed to heightened fraud risk, which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses. \n",
      "\n",
      "For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, and such fees result in significant costs. Payment card network costs have increased, and may continue to increase in the future, the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks, and may impose special fees or assessments on any such transaction. Our payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us. Credit card transactions result in higher fees to us than transactions made through debit cards. Any material increase in interchange fees in the United States or other geographies, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations imposed by law in some geographies, or other network fees or assessments, or a shift from payment with debit cards to credit cards could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

When a guest books and pays for a stay or experience on our platform, we hold the total amount the guest has paid until check-in, at which time we recognize our service fee as revenue and initiate the process to remit the payment to the Host, which generally occurs 24 hours after the scheduled check-in, barring any alterations or cancellations, which may result in funds being returned to the guest. Accordingly, at any given time, we hold on behalf of our Hosts and guests a substantial amount of funds, which are generally held in bank deposit accounts and in U.S. treasury bills and recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to either safeguard customer funds in bankruptcy-remote bank accounts, or hold such funds in eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in such jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount held on behalf of customers. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the cash underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our offerings and tiers, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our platform and services, and result in significant penalties and fines from regulators, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

We also rely on such banks and financial institutions to help process payments transactions. We have both significant funds flows from and to various financial institutions as a result of our processing of payments from guests to Hosts. As part of our currency hedging activities on these balances, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with \n",

If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets may be limited by the counterparty&#8217;s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, our ability to process payment transactions via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses and be required to make payments to Hosts and/or refunds to guests out of our own funds, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

In addition, we may finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could result in further dilution to our existing stockholders. We may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs.

This includes registered domain names, registered and unregistered trademarks, service marks, and copyrights, patents and patent applications, trade secrets, licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds, and other forms of intellectual property rights in the United States and in a number of countries around the world. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents, trademarks, domain name registrations, and copyrights from third parties.

Moreover, companies in the Internet and technology industries are frequent targets of practicing and non-practicing entities seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses.

In addition to using open source software, we also license to others some of our software through open source projects. Open sourcing our own software requires us to make the source code publicly available, and therefore can limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to that software. From time to time, companies that use open source software have faced claims challenging the use of open source software or compliance with open source license terms. Furthermore, there \n",

We have implemented policies, procedures, systems, and controls designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and to discourage corrupt practices by our employees, consultants, and agents, and to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions under such laws and regulations; however, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and we cannot ensure that all such parties, including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate U.S. or other laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies, for which we may be ultimately responsible. Additional compliance requirements may require us to revise or expand our compliance programs, including the procedures we use to monitor international and domestic transactions. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations may result in extensive internal or external investigations as well as significant financial penalties and reputational harm, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Therefore, we have made decisions, and may in the future make decisions, that we believe are in the long-term best interests of our company and our shareholders, even if such decisions may negatively impact the short- or medium-term performance of our business, results of operations, and financial condition or the short- or medium-term performance of our Class A common stock. Our commitment to pursuing long-term value for the company and its shareholders, potentially at the expense of short- or medium-term performance, may materially adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock, including by making owning our Class A common stock less appealing to investors who are focused on returns over a shorter time horizon. Our decisions and actions in pursuit of long-term success and long-term shareholder value, which may include changes to our platform to enhance the experience of our Hosts, guests, and the communities in which we operate, including by improving the trust and safety of our platform, changes in the manner in which we deliver community support, investing in our relationships with our Hosts, guests, and employees, investing in and introducing new products and services, or changes in our approach to working with local or national jurisdictions on laws and regulations governing our business, may not result in the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the trading price of our Class A common stock, could be materially adversely affected. \n",

Stock prices of many companies, including travel companies and technology companies, have fluctuated in a manner often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our Class A common stock following our recent initial public offering as a result of the supply and demand forces for newly public companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of stock volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

This ownership will limit or preclude other stockholders&#8217; ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. \n",

      "Our Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, our Class C common stock has no votes per share, and our Class H common stock has no votes per share. As of December 31, 2021, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock beneficially owned 41.9% of our outstanding capital stock and held 93.7% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, with our directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, and their respective affiliates, beneficially owning 40.5% of our outstanding capital stock and holding 86.3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the 20-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively continue to control a significant percentage of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until all such outstanding shares of Class B common stock have converted into shares of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, our founders, who collectively held 67.1% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2021, are party to a Voting Agreement under which each founder and his affiliates and certain other entities agree to vote their shares for the election of each individual founder to our board of directors. We and each of our founders are party to a Nominating Agreement under which we and the founders are required to take certain actions to include the founders in the slate of nominees nominated by our board of directors for the applicable class of directors, include them in our proxy statement, and solicit proxies or consents in favor of electing each founder to our board of directors. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that stockholders may believe are in their best interest. \n",

      "Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes or transfers among our founders, if all of our founders agree to such transfers. Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Class B holder into one share of Class A common stock. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result, it is possible that one or more of the persons or entities holding our Class B common stock could gain significant voting control as other holders of Class B common stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into Class A common stock. In addition, the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. In addition, any future issuances of common stock would be dilutive to holders of Class A common stock. For example, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. Further, each outstanding share of Class H common stock will convert into a share of Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis upon the sale of such share of Class H common stock to any person or entity that is not our subsidiary, which would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. \n",

      "We cannot predict whether our multi-series structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers, such as S&#38;P Dow Jones, have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indices, including the S&#38;P 500. Accordingly, the multi-series structure of our common stock would make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices may not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Because of the multi-class structure of our common stock, we will likely be excluded from certain indices and we cannot assure that other stock indices will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors.

Our authorized but unissued shares of Class C common stock are available for issuance with the approval of our board of directors without stockholder approval, except as may be required by the Listing Rules of Nasdaq. Because the Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), is not convertible into any other capital stock, and is not listed for trading on an exchange or registered for sale with the SEC, shares of Class C common stock may be less liquid and less attractive to any future recipients of these shares than shares of Class A common stock, although we may seek to list the Class C common stock for trading and register shares of Class C common stock for sale in the future. In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue shares of Class C common stock in the future, the holders of our Class B common stock, including our founders who are parties to a Nominating Agreement and a Voting Agreement, may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions.

      "Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide, that: (i) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware) will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company, (B) any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder to the company or our stockholders, including without limitation a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (C) any action asserting a claim against the company or any of our current or former director, officer, employee, agent or stockholder arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (D) any action asserting a claim related to or involving the company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; (ii) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (iii) any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the company will be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions; and (iv) failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause us irreparable harm, and we will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. Nothing in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), from bringing such claims in federal court to the extent that the Exchange Act confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable law. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act. \n",
      "\n",
      "The choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent, or stockholder to the company, which may discourage such claims against us or any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent, or stockholder to the company and result in increased costs for investors to bring a claim. \n",
      "\n",
      "General Risk Factors \n",
      "\n",
      "The value of our marketable securities could decline, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our marketable securities portfolio includes various holdings, types, and maturities. Market values of these investments can be adversely impacted by various factors, including liquidity in the underlying security, credit deterioration, the financial condition of the credit issuer, foreign exchange rates, and changes in interest rates. Our marketable securities, which we consider highly-liquid investments, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&#8217; equity (deficit). Realized gains and losses and other than-temporary impairments are reported within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Our marketable equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the fair value of our marketable equity securities declines, our earnings will be reduced or losses will be increased. Furthermore, our interest income from cash, cash equivalents, and our marketable securities are impacted by changes in interest rates, and a decline in interest rates would adversely impact our interest income. \n",
      "\n",
      "We incur significant expenses as a result of being a public company, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC, and the Listing Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;). Stockholder activism and the level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional significant compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. The increased costs will increase our net loss or decrease our net income, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase our service fees which could result in a reduction in bookings. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees, or as executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our Class A common stock, fines, sanctions, and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation. These obligations and constituents require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a public reporting company, we are subject to rules and regulations established by the SEC and Nasdaq regarding our internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete needed improvements to our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock and your investment. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established by the SEC and Nasdaq. These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel, including senior management. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management&#8217;s initial certification under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was provided with this annual report on Form 10-K. In support of such certifications, we were required to document and make significant changes and enhancements, including hiring additional personnel, to our internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm provided an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. We anticipate to continue investing significant resources to enhance and maintain our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems, and procedures. \n",
      "\n",
      "If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we identify or fail to remediate material weaknesses in our internal controls, or we do not effectively or accurately report our financial performance to the appropriate regulators on a timely basis, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of investor confidence, which could significantly harm our reputation and our stock price, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "The failure to successfully implement and maintain accounting systems could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the third quarter of 2019, we implemented a new third-party revenue accounting system in order to automate our revenue accounting and reporting processes. System implementations of this scale are complex and time-consuming projects that require transformations of business and financial processes. Such transformations involve risk inherent in the conversion to a new system, including loss of information and potential disruption to normal operations. Additionally, if our revenue and other accounting or tax systems do not operate as intended or do not scale with anticipated growth in our business, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected. Any failure to develop, implement, or maintain effective internal controls related to our revenue and other accounting or tax systems and associated reporting could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, if we experience interruptions in service or operational difficulties with our revenue and other accounting or tax systems, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in accounting principles. \n",
      "\n",
      "The accounting for our business is subject to change based on the evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting and financial reporting requirements of the SEC or other regulatory agencies. Adoption of a change in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the adoption of such change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles and accounting policies over financial reporting, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could require significant investment in systems and personnel. \n",
      "\n",
      "&#160; \n",
      "\n",
      "Avoiding regulation under the Investment Company Act may adversely affect our operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which &#8220;investment companies&#8221; are permitted to conduct their business activities. We currently conduct, and intend to continue to conduct, our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We are not engaged primarily, nor do we hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and neither do we intend to own investment securities with a combined value in excess of 40% of the value, as determined by our board of directors, of our total assets, exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items, on an unconsolidated basis. We do, however, make minority investments in companies and acquire other financial instruments from time to time that may be deemed investment securities. We expect to conduct our operations such that the value of those investments will not rise to a level where we might be deemed an investment company, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining the required ratios without taking actions that may adversely affect our operations. For example, to avoid being deemed an investment company we may be required to sell certain of our assets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "\n",
      "Our business, operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the trading price of our Class A common stock. The following material factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors, and oral statements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Risks Related to Our Business \n",
      "\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have materially adversely impacted and will continue to materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, governments have imposed various restrictions, including emergency declarations at the federal, state, and local levels, school and business closings, quarantines, &#8220;shelter at home&#8221; orders, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other social distancing measures, which have had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business and operations and on travel behavior and demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and may continue to require cost reduction measures, has materially adversely affected our near-term operating and financial results and will continue to materially adversely impact our long-term operating and financial results. During the fourth quarter of 2020, another wave of COVID-19 infections emerged. As a result, countries imposed strict lockdowns, in particular in Europe. Similar to the impact of the initial COVID-19 wave in March 2020, we are seeing a decrease in bookings in the most affected regions and saw a significantly greater year-over-year decline in Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV in the fourth quarter of 2020 than in the third quarter of 2020. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do not believe it is possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business, results of operations, and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and extent of the spread of COVID-19 both globally and within the United States, the prevalence of local, national, and international travel restrictions, significantly reduced flight volume, the impact on capital and financial markets and on the U.S. and global economies, foreign currencies exchange, and governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Moreover, even after shelter-in-place orders and travel advisories are lifted, demand for our offerings, particularly those related to cross-border travel, may remain depressed for a significant length of time, and we cannot predict if and when demand will return to pre-COVID-19 levels. In addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had and will have on our business partners and third-party vendors and service providers, and we may continue to be materially adversely impacted as a result of the material adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer now and in the future. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in these &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, will materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, in May 2020, we announced a reduction in our workforce of approximately 1,800 employees. This reduction in workforce particularly impacted our marketing, design, customer service, transportation, Airbnb Studios, Hotels, and Airbnb Luxe teams. This reduction in workforce also resulted in the loss of institutional knowledge, relationships, and expertise for critical roles, which may not have been effectively transferred to continuing employees and may divert attention from operating our business, create personnel capacity constraints, and hamper our ability to grow, develop innovative products, and compete. Any of these impacts could materially adversely impact our business and reputation and impede our ability to operate or meet strategic objectives. This has led to increased attrition and could lead to reduced employee morale and productivity and problems retaining existing and recruiting future employees, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The reduction in force and other restructuring activities resulted in a charge of $151.4 million in 2020. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most of our employees and third-party vendors and service providers are working remotely, and it is possible that widespread remote work arrangements could have a materially negative impact on host and guest satisfaction resulting from potential delays or slower than usual response times in receiving assistance from our customer support organization. The negative impact on our hosts&#8217; and guests&#8217; satisfaction could adversely impact our operations, the execution of our business plans, and productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, and of third-party service providers that perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurs that impacts our employees&#8217; ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in material consumer privacy, information technology security, and fraud risks. The reduction in force in May 2020 and remote work arrangements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic caused us to recognize an impairment of certain of our real property lease arrangements, and depending on the duration and extent of the remote work arrangements, we may incur additional impairment charges related to our real property lease agreements. The manner in which we have adjusted our business following the COVID-19 pandemic is based on our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance from regulatory authorities, and is subject to legal or regulatory challenge, particularly as regulatory guidance evolves in response to future developments. \n",

      "We incurred net losses of $16.9 million, $674.3 million, and $4.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $6.0 billion. Historically, we have invested significantly in efforts to grow our host and guest community, introduced new or enhanced offerings and features, increased our marketing spend, expanded our operations, hired additional employees, and enhanced our platform. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, we have significantly reduced our fixed and variable costs including a reduction in force and a suspension of substantially all discretionary marketing program spend. However, overall, we expect to resume making significant investments in our business and our host and guest community, including improvements to our payments platform, trust and safety on our platform, technology, infrastructure, and investments in our brand. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. In particular, we expect the ongoing economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to materially and adversely impact our revenue and financial results for 2021. While we have enacted measures to reduce our expenses, we expect to incur a significant net loss for 2021 primarily as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, stock-based compensation expense, and interest expense. \n",

      "Certain of our offerings and certain regions in which we operate result in listings with lower service fees and will require significant additional investments from us, which could have a materially negative impact on our overall operating margins as these offerings and regions increase in size over time relative to other areas in which we operate. For example, seats for Airbnb Experiences are generally booked at lower prices than nights booked for stays. In addition, we have changed, and may in the future reduce, our service fees for strategic or competitive reasons. Any failure to increase our revenue or any failure to manage the increase in our operating expenses could prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability as measured by net income, operating income, or Adjusted EBITDA. \n",

      "We have granted restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) to our employees and certain non-employees, with substantially all of such RSUs vesting upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity-based vesting condition. Our financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and for the year then-ended include stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 billion associated with the vesting of RSUs in connection with our initial public offering for which the requisite service-based vesting condition was met as of December 31, 2020. Following our initial public offering in December 2020, we began recording stock-based compensation expense for RSUs where the liquidity-based vesting condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of our registration statement for the initial public offering on December 9, 2020. Stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other equity awards will continue to be a significant expense in future periods. \n",

Our Free Cash Flow was $504.9 million, $97.3 million, and $(667.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow declined in 2019, as a result of our decision to make 2019 a year in which we made significant investments in new product and growth initiatives, including in China, and to improve our technical infrastructure. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on the travel industry, our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow remained negative in 2020, and we may experience declines in Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as long as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to materially adversely impact our business. Other adverse developments in our business, including lower than anticipated revenue, higher than anticipated operating expenses, and net unfavorable changes in working capital, could hinder our ability to reverse the recent negative trend in our Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. If our future Adjusted EBITDA or Free Cash Flow fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, it is likely to have a materially negative effect on our stock price. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are supplemental metrics that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. See the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP and for additional information. \n",

These practices are outside of our direct control. If hosts do not establish or maintain a sufficient number of listings and availability for listings, the number of Nights and Experiences Booked declines for a particular period, or the price charged by hosts declines, our revenue would decline and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "Hosts manage and control their spaces and experiences and typically market them on our platform with no obligation to make them available to guests for specified dates and with no obligation to accept bookings from prospective guests. We have had many hosts list their properties on our platform in one period and cease to offer these properties in subsequent periods for a variety of reasons. While we plan to continue to invest in our host community and in tools to assist hosts, these investments may not be successful in growing our hosts and listings on our platform. In addition, hosts may not establish or maintain listings if we cannot attract prospective guests to our platform and generate bookings from a large number of guests. If we are unable to retain existing hosts or add new hosts, or if hosts elect to market their listings exclusively with a competitor or cross-list with a competitor, we may be unable to offer a sufficient supply and variety of properties or experiences to attract guests to use our platform. In particular, it is critical that we continue to attract and retain individual hosts who list their spaces, including private rooms, primary homes, or vacation homes on Airbnb. We attract individual hosts predominantly through organic channels such as word of mouth and our strong brand recognition. If we are unable to attract and retain individual hosts in a cost-effective manner, or at all, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. \n",

These professional hosts often list on our platform as well as on the platforms of our competitors. We do not control whether professional hosts provide us with a sizable allocation of rooms and competitive pricing relative to the same properties listed with other services. If we are not able to effectively deploy professional tools, application programming interfaces, and payment processes, work with third-party channel managers, and develop effective sales and account management teams that address the needs of these professional hosts, we may not be able to attract and retain professional hosts. If our fee structure and payment terms are not as competitive as those of our competitors, these professional hosts may choose to provide less inventory and availability with us. Historically, we have seen an increase in the number of, and revenue from, professional hosts on our platform. The uniqueness of listings on our platform will be negatively impacted if the number of individual hosts does not grow at the same rate. \n",

      "In addition, the number of listings on Airbnb has declined and may continue to decline as a result of a number of other factors affecting hosts, including&#58; the COVID-19 pandemic&#59; enforcement or threatened enforcement of laws and regulations, including short-term occupancy and tax laws&#59; private groups, such as homeowners, landlords, and condominium and neighborhood associations, adopting and enforcing contracts that prohibit or restrict home sharing&#59; leases, mortgages and other agreements, or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict home sharing&#59; hosts opting for long-term rentals on other third-party platforms as an alternative to listing on our platform&#59; economic, social, and political factors&#59; perceptions of trust and safety on and off our platform&#59; negative experiences with guests, including guests who damage host property, throw unauthorized parties, or engage in violent and unlawful acts&#59; and our decision to remove hosts from our platform for not adhering to our host standards or other factors we deem detrimental to our community. We believe a number of our hosts are individuals who rely on the additional income generated from our platform to pay their living expenses or mortgages or have acquired properties specifically for listing. It is not yet clear what financial impact the severe travel reduction occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic will have on these individuals or whether they will be able to keep their homes or operate their businesses as travel resumes.

For these reservations, eligible hosts are entitled to receive 25% of the amount they would have received from guests under the host&#8217;s cancellation policies. Because this commitment is limited in amount and timeframe, hosts will not receive full payment related to guest cancellations, and some hosts may remove their listings from our platform if they are not satisfied with our policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have not seen a material change in the number of active listings on our platform between December 2019 and December 2020.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused many governments to implement quarantines and significant restrictions on travel or to advise that people remain at home where possible and avoid crowds, which has had a particularly negative impact on cross-border travel. In addition, most airlines have suspended or significantly reduced their flights during this period, further decreasing opportunities for travel. This has led to a decrease in our bookings and an increase in cancellations and associated claims brought against us. We expect that COVID-19 will continue to materially adversely impact our bookings and business in 2021 and beyond. The extent and duration of such impact over the longer term remains uncertain and is dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the timing, availability, and effectiveness of a vaccine, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions, and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior in general, and on our business in particular.

Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected, which could lead to a decline in the bookings and prices for stays and experiences on our platform and an increase in cancellations, and thus result in lower revenue. Leisure travel in particular, which accounts for a substantial majority of our current business, is dependent on discretionary consumer spending levels. Downturns in worldwide or regional economic conditions, such as the current downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a general decrease in leisure travel and travel spending, and similar downturns in the future may materially adversely impact demand for our platform and services.

      "Since we began our operations in 2008, there have been and continue to be legal and regulatory developments that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business. Hotels and groups affiliated with hotels have engaged and will likely continue to engage in various lobbying and political efforts for stricter regulations governing our business in both local and national jurisdictions. Other private groups, such as homeowners, landlords, and condominium and neighborhood associations, have adopted contracts or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict short-term rentals, and third-party lease agreements between landlords and tenants, home insurance policies, and mortgages may prevent or restrict the ability of hosts to list their spaces. In Europe, a group of mayors representing 22 cities (including Amsterdam, Barcelona, and London) has been meeting with the European Commission to seek increased regulatory control in relation to short-term rental platforms. These groups and others cite concerns around affordable housing and over-tourism in major cities, and some state and local governments have implemented or considered implementing rules, ordinances, or regulations governing the short-term rental of properties and&#47;or home sharing. Such regulations include ordinances that restrict or ban hosts from short-term rentals, set annual caps on the number of days hosts can share their homes, require hosts to register with the municipality or city, or require hosts to obtain permission before offering short-term rentals. In addition, some jurisdictions regard short-term rental or home sharing as &#8220;hotel use&#8221; and claim that such use constitutes a conversion of a residential property to a commercial property requiring a permitting process. Macroeconomic pressures and public policy concerns could continue to lead to new laws and regulations, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, that limit the ability of hosts to share their spaces. If laws, regulations, rules, or agreements significantly restrict or discourage hosts in certain jurisdictions from sharing their properties, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "While a number of cities and countries have implemented legislation to address short-term rentals, there are many others that are not yet explicitly addressing or enforcing short-term rental laws, and could follow suit and enact regulations. New laws, regulations, government policies, or changes in their interpretations in the approximately 100,000 cities where we operate entail significant challenges and uncertainties. In the event of any such changes, pre-existing bookings may not be honored and current and future listings and bookings could decline significantly, and our relationship with our hosts and guests could be negatively impacted, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, if new city regulations requiring us to share host data with such city are implemented, our revenue from listings there may be substantially reduced due to the departure from our platform of hosts who do not wish to share their data with the city. A reduction in supply and cancellations could make our platform less attractive to guests, and any reduction in the number of guests could further reduce the number of hosts on our platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "While we seek to work with governments, we have in the past, and are likely in the future to, become involved in disputes with government agencies regarding such laws and regulations. For example, some governments have attempted to impose fines on us regarding what they contend is illegal offering of short-term accommodations in violation of applicable laws. Certain jurisdictions have adopted laws and regulations that seek to impose various types of taxes, including lodging taxes, often known as transient or occupancy taxes, on our guests, collection and remittance obligations on our hosts and&#47;or us, and withholding obligations on us, as more fully described in our risk factor titled &#8220;&#8212; Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform.&#8221; In addition, some third parties and regulators have asserted that we, through our operations, are subject to regulations with respect to short-term rentals, host registration, licensing, and other requirements for the listing of accommodations and experiences, such as real estate broker or agent licenses, travel agency licenses, and insurance-related licenses. We could be held liable and incur significant financial and potential criminal penalties if we are found to have violated any of these regulations. In certain jurisdictions, we have resolved disputes concerning the application of these laws and regulations by agreeing, among other things, to share certain data with government agencies to assist in the enforcement of limits on short-term rentals as well as the enforcement of safety regulations, and to implement measures to confirm to the government that hosts are operating in compliance with applicable law. When a government agency seeks to apply laws and regulations in a manner that limits or curtails hosts&#8217; or guests&#8217; ability or willingness to list and search for accommodations in that particular geography, we have attempted and may continue to attempt through litigation or other means to defend against such application of laws and regulations, but have sometimes been and may continue to be unsuccessful in certain of those efforts.

Moreover, the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate are distinct and may result in inconsistent or ambiguous interpretations among local, regional, or national laws or regulations applicable to our business. Compliance with laws and regulations of different jurisdictions imposing varying standards and requirements is burdensome for businesses like ours, imposes added cost and increases potential liability to our business, and makes it difficult to realize business efficiencies and economies of scale. For example, we incur significant operational costs to comply with requirements of jurisdictions and cities that have disparate requirements around tax collection, tax reporting, host registration, limits on lengths of stays, and other regulations, each of which require us to dedicate significant resources to provide the infrastructure and tools needed on our platform for our hosts to meet these legal requirements and for us to fulfill any obligations we may have.

Uncertain and unclear application of such laws and regulations to host and guest activity and our platform could cause and has caused some hosts and guests to leave or choose not to use our platform, reduce supply and demand for our platform and services, increase the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, and increase the threat of litigation or enforcement actions related to our platform, all of which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our newer offerings, such as Airbnb Experiences, are subject to similar or other laws, regulations, and regulatory actions.

Our platform relies upon content that is created and posted by hosts, guests, or other third parties. Although content on our platform is typically generated by third parties, and not by us, claims of defamation, disparagement, negligence, warranty, personal harm, intellectual property infringement, or other alleged damages could be asserted against us, in addition to our hosts and guests. While we rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses, including those provided by the DMCA, the CDA, the fair-use doctrine and various tort law defenses in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in the European Union, differences between statutes, limitations on immunity or responsibility, requirements to maintain immunity or proportionate responsibility, and moderation efforts in the many jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our ability to rely on these frameworks and defenses, or create uncertainty regarding liability for information or content uploaded by hosts and guests or otherwise contributed by third-parties to our platform. Moreover, regulators in the United States and in other countries may introduce new regulatory regimes that increase potential liability for information or content available on our platform. For example, in the United States, laws such as the CDA, which have previously been interpreted to provide substantial protection to interactive computer service providers, may change and become less predictable or unfavorable by legislative action or juridical interpretation. There have been various federal legislative efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under the CDA, in particular with regards to Section 230 of the CDA, and current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. There is proposed U.S. federal legislation seeking to hold platforms liable for user-generated content, including content related to short-term rentals. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. The European Union is also reviewing the regulation of digital services, and in December 2020, the European Commission published a draft of the proposed Digital Services Act (&#8220;DSA&#8221;), a package of legislation intended to update the liability and safety rules for digital platforms, products, and services, which could negatively impact the scope of the limited immunity provided by the E-Commerce Directive. Some European jurisdictions have also proposed or intend to pass legislation that imposes new obligations and liabilities on platforms with respect to certain types of harmful content. In parallel, the European Commission also published a legislative proposal to introduce new ex ante regulation of online platforms and new market investigation powers as a separate piece of legislation, the Digital Markets Act (&#8220;DMA&#8221;). If the DMA is enacted, it may contain certain regulatory requirements and&#47;or obligations that negatively impact our business. Some European jurisdictions (such as the United Kingdom and Germany) are also reviewing their competition rules in relation to digital platforms which could lead to new regulations similar to the DMA at national level. While the scope and timing of these proposals are currently evolving, if enacted and applied to our platform, the new rules may adversely affect our business. In countries in Asia and Latin America, generally there are not similar statutes as the CDA or E-Commerce Directive. The laws of countries in Asia and Latin America generally provide for direct liability if a platform is involved in creating such content or has actual knowledge of the content without taking action to take it down. Further, laws in some Asian countries also provide for primary or secondary liability, which can include criminal liability, if a platform failed to take sufficient steps to prevent such content from being uploaded. Because liability often flows from information or content on our platform and&#47;or services accessed through our platform, as we continue to expand our offerings, tiers, and scope of business, both in terms of the range of offerings and services and geographical operations, we may face or become subject to additional or different laws and regulations. Our potential liability for information or content created by third parties and posted to our platform could require us to implement additional measures to reduce our exposure to such liability, may require us to expend significant resources, may limit the desirability of our platform to hosts and guests, may cause damage to our brand or reputation, and may cause us to incur time and costs defending such claims in litigation, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Certain verification processes, including legacy verification processes on which we previously relied, may be less reliable than others. We screen against certain regulatory, terrorist, and sanctions watch lists, conduct certain criminal background checks for U.S. hosts, U.S. guests, and hosts in India, and conduct additional screening processes to flag and investigate suspicious activities. These processes are beneficial but not exhaustive and have limitations due to a variety of factors, including laws and regulations that prohibit or limit our ability to conduct effective background checks in some jurisdictions, the unavailability of information, and the inability of our systems to detect all suspicious activity. There can be no assurances that these measures will significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on our platform. The criminal background checks for U.S. hosts, U.S. guests, and hosts in India, and other screening processes rely on, among other things, information provided by hosts and guests, our ability to validate that information, the accuracy, completeness, and availability of the underlying information relating to criminal records, the digitization of certain records, the evolving regulatory landscape in this area such as in the data privacy space, and on the effectiveness of third-party service providers that may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility, and we do not run criminal background checks and other screening processes on third parties who may be present during a reservation made through our platform. \n",

We have not in the past and may not in the future undertake to independently verify the location, safety, or suitability of experiences for individual guests, the suitability, qualifications, or credentials of experiences hosts, or the qualifications of individual experiences guests. In the limited circumstances where we have undertaken the verification or screening of certain aspects of host qualifications, listings or experiences, the scope of such processes may be limited and rely on, among other things, information provided by hosts and guests and the ability of our internal teams or third-party vendors to adequately conduct such verification or screening practices. In addition, we have not in the past taken and may not in the future take steps to re-verify or re-screen host qualifications, listings, or experiences following initial review. We have in the past relied, and may in the future, rely on hosts and guests to disclose information relating to their listings and experiences and such information may be inaccurate or incomplete. We have created policies and standards to respond to issues reported with listings, but certain listings may pose heightened safety risks to individual users because those issues have not been reported to us or because our customer support team has not taken the requisite action based on our policies. We rely, at least in part, on reports of issues from hosts and guests to investigate and enforce many of our policies and standards. In addition, our policies may not contemplate certain safety risks posed by listings or individual hosts or guests or may not sufficiently address those risks. \n",

While we recognize that we need to continue to build trust and invest in innovations that will support trust when it comes to our policies, tools, and procedures to protect hosts, guests, and the communities in which our hosts operate, we may not be successful in doing so.

Such incidents have prompted, and may in the future prompt, stricter home sharing regulations or regulatory inquiries into our platform policies and business practices. In the United States and other countries, we have seen listings being used for parties in violation of Airbnb&#8217;s policies which have in some cases resulted in neighborhood disruption or violence. Further, claims have been asserted against us from our hosts, guests, and third parties for compensation due to fatalities, accidents, injuries, assaults, theft, property damage, privacy and security issues, fraudulent listings, and other incidents that are caused by other hosts, guests, or third parties while using our platform. These claims subject us to potentially significant liability and increase our operating costs and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We have obtained some third-party insurance, which is subject to certain conditions and exclusions, for claims and losses incurred based on incidents related to bookings on our platform. Even where we do have third-party insurance, such insurance may be inadequate to fully cover alleged claims of liability, investigation costs, defense costs, and&#47;or payouts. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant time and cost investigating and defending against them. As we expand our offerings and tiers, such as the addition of Airbnb Experiences, or if the quantity or severity of incidents increases, our insurance rates and our financial exposure will grow, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

These measures are long-term investments in our business and the trust and safety of our community&#59; however, some of these measures increase friction on our platform by increasing the number of steps required to list or book, which reduces host and guest activity on our platform, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Implementing the trust and safety initiatives we have announced, which include, among other things, limited verification of hosts and listings, restrictions on &#8220;party&#8221; houses, manual screening of certain high-risk reservations, restrictions on certain types of bookings, and our neighbor hotline, or other initiatives, has caused and will continue to cause us to incur significant ongoing expenses and may result in fewer listings and bookings or reduced host and guest retention, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As we operate a global platform, the timing and implementation of these measures will vary across geographies. We have invested and plan to continue to invest significantly in the trust and safety of our platform, but there can be no assurances that these measures will be successful, significantly reduce criminal or fraudulent activity on or off our platform, or be sufficient to protect our reputation in the event of such activity. \n",

      "Furthermore, we have established community standards, but those standards may not always be effectively enforced, communicated to, or consistently understood by all parts of our community. For example, while we require and communicate to hosts and guests to make certain commitments with respect to diversity and belonging when they join Airbnb, these standards and requirements are not always well understood by all parts of our community. As a result, hosts and guests may be surprised or disappointed when their expectations are not met. \n",

      "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have instituted a number of policies and measures to address the use of our platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we have launched cleaning programs and safety practices that are intended to help prevent transmission of COVID-19. All hosts outside of China are asked to commit to these standards, including a uniform five-step cleaning process (hosts in China maintain a separate cleaning program). We provide substantial additional resources and best practices to help hosts implement the cleaning process, including an enhanced cleaning protocol, checklists, and other written and visual materials. Each host is responsible for implementing the cleaning process. We are unable to control or verify the implementation of this process by each host, and following these programs may cause our hosts to incur significant expenditures, which may impact the attractiveness of our platform and may impact hosts&#8217; willingness to list on our platform. Hosts who do not agree to follow these standards may also be suspended or removed from the platform, and our hosts may choose to list on other platforms instead of participating in our cleaning programs. If a significant number of hosts are removed or decide to list on other platforms as a result of our cleaning programs, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Hosts and guests must also agree to follow COVID-19-related safety practices, such as social distancing. If our hosts or guests do not follow the guidelines, they may suffer financial or other repercussions, which may make our platform less appealing and may impact our business. Further, such policies may not be successful in preventing the transmission of COVID-19. Cases of suspected COVID-19 exposure or infection during Airbnb reservations have been reported to us. If guests or hosts believe that booking stays or experiences on our platform poses heightened risks for contracting COVID-19 or other diseases, our reputation and business could be materially adversely affected, and it could give rise to legal claims against us. \n",

      "We believe that maintaining and strengthening our brand is an important aspect of our efforts to attract and retain hosts and guests. In particular, we rely on marketing to drive guest traffic to our platform. We have invested considerable resources into establishing and maintaining our brand. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we realigned our organizational priorities to further increase our focus on individual hosts and brand marketing, while reducing performance marketing. \n",

      "Our brand marketing efforts include a variety of online and offline marketing distribution channels. Our brand marketing efforts are expensive and may not be cost-effective or successful. For example, in November 2019, we announced a partnership with the International Olympic Committee for nine years to cover the next five Olympic Games. The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the 2020 Olympics, and the continued uncertainty around COVID-19 and other geopolitical factors could undermine our ability to realize the value of the partnership. If our competitors spend increasingly more on brand marketing efforts, we may not be able to maintain and grow traffic to our platform. \n",

      "We have used performance marketing products offered by search engines and social media platforms to distribute paid advertisements that drive traffic to our platform. The remainder of our traffic comes through direct or unpaid channels, which include brand marketing and search engine optimization (&#8220;SEO&#8221;). A critical factor in attracting hosts and guests to our platform is how prominently listings are displayed in response to search queries for key search terms. The success of home sharing and our brand has led to increased costs for relevant keywords as our competitors competitively bid on our keywords, including our brand name. Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019. However, we may not be successful at our efforts to drive traffic growth cost-effectively. If we are not able to effectively increase our traffic growth without increases in spend on performance marketing, we may need to increase our performance marketing spend in the future, including in response to increased spend on performance marketing from our competitors, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "The technology that powers much of our performance marketing is increasingly subject to strict regulation, and regulatory or legislative changes could adversely impact the effectiveness of our performance marketing efforts and, as a result, our business. For example, we rely on the placement and use of &#8220;cookies&#8221; &#8212; text files stored on a host or guest&#8217;s web browser or device &#8212; to support tailored marketing to consumers. Many countries have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, regulations governing the use of cookies and similar technologies, and individuals may be required to &#8220;opt-in&#8221; to the placement of cookies used for purposes of marketing. For example, we are subject to evolving EU privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. In the European Union, regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem, and current national laws that implement the ePrivacy Directive are likely to be replaced by an EU Regulation, known as the ePrivacy Regulation, which will significantly increase fines for non-compliance. In the European Union, informed consent may be required for the placement of a cookie on a user&#8217;s device and for direct electronic marketing. The GDPR also imposes conditions on obtaining valid consent, such as a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to ensure separate consents are sought for each type of cookie or similar technology. While the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, a recent European Court of Justice decision and regulators&#8217; recent guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies under existing law. If regulators start to enforce the strict approach, this could lead to substantial costs, require significant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, adversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities. Widespread adoption of regulations that significantly restrict our ability to use performance marketing technology could adversely affect our ability to market effectively to current and prospective hosts and guests, and thus materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "We focus on unpaid channels such as SEO. SEO involves developing our platform in a way that enables a search engine to rank our platform prominently for search queries for which our platform&#8217;s content may be relevant. Changes to search engine algorithms or similar actions are not within our control, and could adversely affect our search-engine rankings and traffic to our platform. We believe that our SEO results have been adversely affected by the launch of Google Travel and Google Vacation Rental Ads, which reduce the prominence of our platform in organic search results for travel-related terms and placement on Google. To the extent that our brand and platform are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search results for any reason, we would need to increase our paid marketing spend which would increase our overall customer acquisition costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If Google or Apple uses its own mobile operating systems or app distribution channels to favor its own or other preferred travel service offerings, or impose policies that effectively disallow us to continue our full product offerings in those channels, there could be an adverse effect on our ability to engage with hosts and guests who access our platform via mobile apps or search. \n",

In addition, any negative publicity or public complaints, including those that impede our ability to maintain positive brand awareness through our marketing and consumer communications efforts, could harm our reputation and lead to fewer hosts and guests using our platform, and attempts to replace this traffic through other channels will require us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures. \n",

Any such default that is not cured or waived could result in an acceleration of indebtedness then outstanding under our Credit Agreements, a requirement that we and our subsidiaries that have guaranteed our indebtedness pay the obligations in full, and would permit the lenders to exercise remedies with respect to all of the collateral that is securing our indebtedness, including substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors&#8217; assets. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with funding under the 2020 Credit Facility.

LIBOR is currently expected to phase out by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate which is currently intended to serve as an alternative reference rate to LIBOR. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available, or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our borrowings. Further, we may need to renegotiate our Credit Agreements or any other borrowings that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. \n",

Further, as we expand our operations in China, we expect to continue to make modifications to the way our website, mobile apps, offerings, and features function in China as compared to other countries. In addition, we need to ensure that our business practices in China are compliant with local laws and regulations, which may be interpreted and enforced in ways that are different from our interpretation, and&#47;or create obligations on us that are costly to meet or conflict with laws in other jurisdictions. \n",

Our failure to comply with such requests or requirements, or conversely our compliance with such requests or requirements, could materially adversely affect our brand, reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.

In particular, the CSL imposes high requirements for the operational security of facilities, including data localization requirements, for operators deemed to be part of the &#8220;critical information infrastructure.&#8221; However, the definition of &#8220;critical information infrastructure&#8221; is not precise, and there are substantial uncertainties as to its ultimate interpretation and whether it applies to us. Chinese regulators are also considering additional regulation restricting the transfer of personal data and important data outside of China, and we could become subject to data localization requirements in the future as a result of this regulation and&#47;or newly-published industry-specific rules and regulations. If we are considered as an operator of &#8220;critical information infrastructure,&#8221; or if we become subject to restrictions under other measures or data localization requirements under other Chinese laws and regulations, we would incur substantial costs to comply or have to change our business practices in a manner that materially adversely affects our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate.

Cancellations and alterations to previously booked trips increased dramatically after the COVID-19 outbreak, as guests were either unable to travel or uncomfortable traveling. While the number of nights and experiences canceled in January 2020 was 13% of the gross nights and experiences booked that month, the number of nights and experiences canceled in March and April 2020 exceeded the number of gross nights and experiences booked during those months.

      "Privacy and data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex, and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, other processing, and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs or have other material adverse effects on our business. As part of host and guest registration and business processes, we collect and use personal data, such as names, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and identity verification information (for example, government issued identification or passport), as well as credit card or other financial information that hosts and guests provide to us. The laws of many states and countries require businesses that maintain such personal data to implement reasonable measures to keep such information secure and otherwise restrict the ways in which such information can be collected and used. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, has resulted and will continue to result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies like ours. The GDPR regulates our collection, control, processing, sharing, disclosure, and other use of data that can directly or indirectly identify a living individual (&#8220;personal data&#8221;), and imposes stringent data protection requirements with significant penalties, and the risk of civil litigation, for noncompliance. \n",

      "Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. It may also lead to civil litigation, with the risks of damages or injunctive relief, or regulatory orders adversely impacting on the ways in which our business can use personal data. Many large geographies, which are important to our success, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and India, have passed or are in the process of passing comparable or other robust data privacy legislation or regulation, which may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. \n",

The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example, how data transfers between EU member states and the United Kingdom will be treated and the role of the United Kingdom&#8217;s Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office with respect to the European Union. Currently there is a four to six-month grace period agreed in the European Union and UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, ending June 30, 2021 at the latest, while the parties discuss an adequacy decision. However, it is not clear whether (and when) an adequacy decision may be granted by the European Commission enabling data transfers from European Union member states to the United Kingdom long term without additional measures. These changes will lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. \n",

      "Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;). Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions&#59; for example, on July 16, 2020, the CJEU invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (&#8220;Privacy Shield&#8221;) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to US entities that had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it noted that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances&#59; this has created uncertainty and increased the risk around our international operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to other mechanisms (particularly standard contractual clauses), we previously relied on our own Privacy Shield certification and, in limited instances, the Privacy Shield certifications of third parties (for example, vendors and partners) for the purposes of transferring personal data from the EEA to the United States. We continue to rely on the standard contractual clauses to transfer personal data outside the EEA, including to the United States. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we rely on derogations provided for by law. These recent developments may require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and, or, receive personal data transfers to the United States and other jurisdictions. As our lead supervisory authorities (the Irish Data Protection Commission, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection and, until the end of 2020, the British ICO), the European Data Protection Board, and other data protection regulators issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and&#47;or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and&#47;or regulatory investigations or fines, and&#47;or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results. \n",

These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. The U.S. government, including Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices.

      "data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;) took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. The CCPA provides new and enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording consumers the right to access and delete their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. The law also prohibits covered businesses from discriminating against consumers (for example, charging more for services) for exercising any of their CCPA rights. The CCPA imposes severe statutory damages as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action is expected to increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. It remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;). The CPRA further expands the CCPA with additional data privacy compliance requirements that may impact our business, and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements. The CPRA and the CCPA may lead other states to pass comparable legislation, with potentially greater penalties, and more rigorous compliance requirements relevant to our business. The effects of the CPRA, the CCPA, and other similar state or federal laws, are significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such legislation. \n",

      "Various other governments and consumer agencies around the world have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices and many have enacted different and often contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically. Compliance with numerous and contradictory requirements of different jurisdictions is particularly difficult and costly for an online business such as ours, which collects personal information from hosts, guests, and other individuals in multiple jurisdictions. If any jurisdiction in which we operate adopts news laws or changes its interpretation of its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or localization such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we could risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources to comply with GDPR, GLBA, CCPA, and other privacy regulations around the world, many of these regulations expose us to the possibility of material penalties, significant legal liability, changes in how we operate or offer our products, and interruptions or cessation of our ability to operate in key geographies, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "Furthermore, to improve the trust and safety on our platform, we conduct certain verification procedures aimed at our hosts, guests, and listings in certain jurisdictions. Such verification procedures may include utilizing public information on the Internet, accessing public databases such as court records, utilizing third-party vendors to analyze host or guest data, or physical inspection. These types of activities may expose us to the risk of regulatory enforcement from privacy regulators and civil litigation. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including tax authorities, state and city regulators, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence agencies, our hosts, guests, and privacy regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, and laws, which could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions. Conversely, if we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement on the interpretation of the law, we are likely to face enforcement action from such government, engage in litigation, face increased regulatory scrutiny, and experience an adverse impact on our relationship with governments or our ability to offer our services within certain jurisdictions.

For example, there are specific rules on the use of automated decision making under the GDPR that require the existence of automated decision making to be disclosed to the data subject with a meaningful explanation of the logic used in such decision making in certain circumstances, and safeguards must be implemented to safeguard individual rights, including the right to obtain human intervention and to contest any decision.

We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, and diversion of internal resources. We could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages or fines or be required to make changes to our business. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant negative publicity, and an erosion of trust.

The evolution of technology systems introduces ever more complex security risks that are difficult to predict and defend against. An increasing number of companies, including those with significant online operations, have recently disclosed breaches of their security, some of which involved sophisticated tactics and techniques allegedly attributable to criminal enterprises or nation-state actors.

This risk has grown in light of the greater adoption of remote work as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also have a distributed community support organization including third-party providers that have access to personal information. We and other companies in our industry have dealt with incidents involving such insiders exfiltrating the personal data of customers, stealing corporate trade secrets and key financial metrics, and illegally diverting funds. No series of measures can fully safeguard against a sufficiently determined and skilled insider threat. \n",

We have seen many instances of our hosts and guests falling prey to such schemes, which result in their accounts being taken over by fraudsters intent on perpetrating fraud against them, other users, and our platform. Bad actors may also employ other schemes aimed at defrauding our hosts or guests in ways that we may not anticipate or be able to adequately guard against. Even if phishing and spamming attacks and other fraud schemes are not carried out through our systems, victims may nevertheless seek recovery from us. Because of our prominence, we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific scheme or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of our offerings, services, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our hosts and guests may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing hosts and guests and attract new hosts and guests. The ability of fraudsters to directly target our hosts and guests with fraudulent communications, or cause an account takeover, exposes us to significant financial fraud risk, including costly litigation, which is difficult to fully mitigate. \n",

      "Generally, our practice is to encrypt certain sensitive data when it is in transit and at rest. However, we do not know whether our current practice will be deemed sufficient under applicable laws or whether new regulatory requirements might make our current practice insufficient. Moreover, the existence of encryption, in-and-of itself, is not a completely perfect security solution. If there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that certain personal data has been exfiltrated, accessed, or used inappropriately, we may need to inform the host or guest whose data was stolen, accessed, or used, and may be subject to significant fines and penalties. Further, under certain regulatory schemes, such as the CCPA, we may be liable for statutory damages on a per breached record basis, irrespective of any actual damages or harm to the individual. This means that in the event of a breach we could face government scrutiny or consumer class actions alleging statutory damages amounting to hundreds of millions, and possibly billions of dollars. \n",

Even if we were to expend more resources, regulators and complainants may not deem our efforts sufficient, and regardless of the expenditure, the risk of security related incidents cannot be fully mitigated. We have a heightened risk of security breaches due to some of our operations being located in certain international jurisdictions.

Our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing attacks on our systems, and any such attack could cause significant interruptions in our operations. For instance, from time to time, we have experienced denial-of-service type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our platform slow or unavailable for periods of time. There are numerous other potential forms of attack, such as phishing, account takeovers, malicious code injections, ransomware, and the attempted use of our platform to launch a denial-of-service attack against another party, each of which could cause significant interruptions in our operations or involve us in legal or regulatory proceedings. Reductions in the availability and response time of our online platform could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such attack on our systems and measures we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customers. These issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and the variety of services we offer, and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced and available. Successful attacks could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation, and could prevent consumers from booking or visiting our platform during the attack, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate and significant loss of revenue, an increase in community support costs, and harm our reputation, and could result in some consumers switching to our competitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system failures, our brand and reputation could be permanently and significantly harmed, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

We have been subject to complaints by, and are involved in a number of lawsuits brought by, certain government entities for alleged responsibility for direct and indirect taxes. In some jurisdictions we are in dispute with respect to past and future taxes. A number of jurisdictions have proposed or implemented new tax laws or interpreted existing laws to explicitly apply various taxes to businesses like ours. Laws and regulations relating to taxes as applied to our platform, and to our hosts and guests, vary greatly among jurisdictions, and it is difficult or impossible to predict how such laws and regulations will be applied. \n",

Some of such tax laws or regulations hold us responsible for the reporting, collection, and payment of such taxes, and such laws could be applied to us for transactions conducted in the past as well as transactions in the future. Many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. New or revised foreign, federal, state, or local tax regulations may subject us or our hosts and guests to additional indirect, income, and other taxes, and depending upon the jurisdiction could subject us or our hosts and guests to significant monetary penalties and fines for non-payment of taxes. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering adopting or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including digital platform revenue-based taxes, targeting online sharing platforms and online marketplaces, and new obligations to collect host income taxes, sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on digital platforms. We may recognize additional tax expenses and be subject to additional tax liabilities, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by additional taxes of this nature or additional taxes or penalties resulting from our failure to comply with any reporting, collection, and payment obligations. We accrue a reserve for such taxes when the likelihood is probable that such taxes apply to us, and upon examination or audit, such reserves may be insufficient. \n",

If we are required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies for tax reporting purposes, our hosts, guests, and regulators could perceive such disclosure as a failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, and laws and commence proceedings or actions against us. If we do not provide the requested information to government agencies due to a disagreement on the interpretation of the law, we are likely to face enforcement action, engage in litigation, face increased regulatory scrutiny, and experience an adverse impact in our relationships with governments. Our competitors may arrive at different or novel solutions to the application of taxes to analogous businesses that could cause our hosts and guests to leave our platform in favor of conducting business on the platforms of our competitors. This uncertainty around the application of taxes and the impact of those taxes on the actual or perceived value of our platform may also cause guests to use OTAs, hotels, or other traditional travel services.

The application of indirect taxes to our hosts, guests, and our platform significantly increases our operational expenses as we build the infrastructure and tools to capture data and to report, collect, and remit taxes. Even if we are able to build the required infrastructure and tools, we may not be able to complete them in a timely fashion, in particular given the speed at which regulations and their interpretations can change, which could harm our relationship with governments and our reputation, and result in enforcement actions and litigation. The lack of uniformity in the laws and regulations relating to indirect taxes as applied to our platform and to our hosts and guests further increases the operational and financial complexity of our systems and processes, and introduces potential for errors or incorrect tax calculations, all of which are costly to our business and results of operations. Certain regulations may be so complex as to make it infeasible for us to be fully compliant. As our business operations expand or change, including as a result of introducing new or enhanced offerings, tiers or features, or due to acquisitions, the application of indirect taxes to our business and to our hosts and guests will further change and evolve, and could further increase our liability for taxes, discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our coastal destinations could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels causing damage to our hosts&#8217; properties and result in a reduced number of listings in these areas. Climate change may also affect our business by increasing the cost of, or making unavailable, property insurance on terms our hosts find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs for our hosts, including the cost of water or energy, and requiring our hosts to expend funds as they seek to repair and protect their properties in connection with such events. As a result of the foregoing and other climate-related issues, our hosts may decide to remove their listings from our platform.

Our results of operations could also be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar as a large portion of our costs are U.S. dollar-denominated. We also have foreign exchange risk with respect to certain of our assets, principally cash balances held on behalf of hosts and guests, that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, and our financial results are affected by the remeasurement and translation of these non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars, which is reflected in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the effects of exchange rates on our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $134.1 million due to fluctuations in exchange rates and the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, our platform generally enables guests to make payments in the currency of their choice to the extent that the currency is supported by Airbnb, which may not match the currency in which the host elects to get paid. In those cases, we bear the currency risk of both the guest payment as well as the host payment due to timing differences in such payments. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded net foreign currency gains of $31.5 million in our consolidated statement of operations. While we have and may choose to enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure in the future, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of foreign exchange rate exposure.

For example, our 2008 to 2020 tax years remain subject to examination in the United States and California due to tax attributes and statutes of limitations, and our 2016 to 2020 tax years remain subject to examination in Ireland. We are currently under examination for income taxes by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) for the years 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018. We are continuing to respond to inquiries related to these examinations. In December 2020, we received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for the 2013 tax year relating to the valuation of our international intellectual property which was sold to a subsidiary in 2013. The notice proposes an increase to our U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense and cash tax liability of $1.35 billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $1.0 billion. We disagree with the proposed adjustment and intend to vigorously contest it. If we are not able to resolve the proposed adjustment at the IRS examination-level, we plan to pursue all available administrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies which may include&#58; entering into administrative settlement discussions with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (&#8220;IRS Appeals&#8221;) in 2021, and if necessary petitioning the U.S. Tax Court (&#8220;Tax Court&#8221;) for redetermination if an acceptable outcome cannot be reached with IRS Appeals, and finally, and if necessary, appealing the Tax Court&#8217;s decision to the appropriate appellate court. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position and such tax and related interest and penalties, if any, exceeds our current reserves, such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations, and any assessment of additional tax could require a significant cash payment and have a material adverse impact on our cash flow. \n",

      "In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed a restructuring plan to repatriate our intellectual property to the United States to align with our evolving operations in a post COVID-19 environment. The restructuring plan involved numerous intercompany arrangements and tax jurisdictions and required the valuation of multiple intercompany transactions which could be challenged by respective tax authorities, including as a result of reduced valuations caused by forecast adjustments due to the impact of COVID-19, and any adverse outcome of any review or audit could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We are currently under a multilateral control (&#8220;MLC&#8221;) audit where a number of individual European state audits are combined. The MLC audit is focused on VAT characterization and compliance, access to host data, and transfer pricing.

      "The determination of our worldwide provision for (benefit from) income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Changes in accounting for intercompany transactions may also affect our effective tax rate. For example, with the adoption of ASU No. 2016-16, effective January 1, 2018, the income tax effects of an intercompany transfer are recognized in the period in which the transfer occurs, rather than amortized over time, which may increase the impact of such transfers on our effective tax rate in a particular period. Although we believe that our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future tax expense could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. For example, we have previously incurred losses in the United States and certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the United States and this could continue to happen in the future. We may also be subject to additional tax liability relating to indirect or other non-income taxes, as described in our risk factor titled &#8220;&#8212; Uncertainty in the application of taxes to our hosts, guests, or platform could increase our tax liabilities and may discourage hosts and guests from conducting business on our platform.&#8221; Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",

In addition, on December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;Tax Act&#8221;) was enacted, which contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a transition to a more territorial system of taxation. The primary impact of this legislation on our provision for (benefit from) income taxes was a reduction of the future tax benefits of our deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate. Since we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets, these changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, the impact of the Tax Act will likely be subject to ongoing technical guidance and accounting interpretation, the issuance of which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the period issued. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act contains certain tax provisions, including provisions that retroactively and&#47;or temporarily suspend or relax in certain respects the application of certain provisions in the Tax Act, such as the limitations on the deduction of net operating losses and interest. In addition, many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and states, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries and states where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. For example, in Italy, a 2017 law requires short-term rental platforms that process payments to collect and remit host income tax and tourist tax, amongst other obligations. Airbnb has challenged this law before the Italian courts but if we are unsuccessful this will lead to further compliance and potentially significant prior and future tax obligations. \n",

Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income (including indirect) taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue.

      "As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of $116.7 million and $5.1 billion, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards subject to expiration will expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2034. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $167.6 million and $2.5 billion, respectively. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2033. We generated significant stock compensation deductions as a result of our initial public offering starting in the fourth quarter of 2020, which substantially increased the size of our net operating loss carryforwards. While federal net operating loss carryforwards generated on or after January 1, 2018 are not subject to expiration, the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforwards is limited to 80% of our taxable income for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. Realization of these net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future taxable income, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation&#8217;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change taxable income or income tax liabilities may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable income or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us. \n",

      "People regularly access the Internet through mobile phones, tablets, handheld computers, voice-assisted speakers, television set-top devices, smart televisions, wearables, and automobile in-dash systems. These devices enable new modalities of interaction, such as conversational user interfaces, and new intermediaries, such as &#8220;super-apps&#8221; like WeChat, where consumers can use many online services without leaving a particular app. We anticipate that the use of these means of access will continue to grow and that usage through desktop computers will continue to decline, especially in certain regions of the world experiencing the highest rate of Internet adoption. The functionality and user experiences associated with these alternative devices, such as a smaller screen size or lack of a screen, may make the use of our platform through such devices more difficult than through a desktop computer, lower the use of our platform, and make it more difficult for our hosts to upload content to our platform. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns can differ on alternative devices, and it is uncertain how the proliferation of mobile devices will impact the use of our platform and services. Mobile consumers may also be unwilling to download multiple apps from multiple companies providing similar services meaning that such consumers may opt to use one of our competitors&#8217; services instead of ours. As a result, brand recognition and the consumer experience with our mobile app will likely become increasingly important to our business. In addition, these new modalities create opportunities for device or systems companies, such as Amazon, Apple, and Google, to control the interaction with our consumers and disintermediate existing platforms such as ours. \n",
      "\n",
      "We need to provide solutions for consumers who are limited in the size of the app they can support on their mobile devices and address latency issues in countries with lower bandwidth for both desktop and mobile devices. Because our platform contains data-intensive media, these issues are exacerbated. As new devices, operating systems, and platforms continue to be released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our offerings and features to them, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of our offerings and features. \n",

In addition, if accessibility of various apps is limited by executive order or other government actions, the full functionality of devices may not be available to our customers. Moreover, third-party platforms, services and offerings are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with those of third parties. If we lose such interoperability, we experience difficulties or increased costs in integrating our offerings into alternative devices or systems, or manufacturers or operating systems elect not to include our offerings, make changes that degrade the functionality of our offerings, or give preferential treatment to competitive products, the growth of our community and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. This risk may be exacerbated by the frequency with which consumers change or upgrade their devices.

In 2018, we began making incremental investments in upgrading our technology platform to a service-oriented architecture, improving data management, and increasing our service reliability, and we invested heavily in our technology in 2019. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt our platform and services to evolving industry standards and local preferences and to continually innovate and improve the performance, features, and reliability of our platform and services in response to competitive offerings and the evolving demands of hosts and guests. Our future success will also depend on our ability to adapt to emerging technologies such as tokenization, cryptocurrencies, new authentication technologies, such as biometrics, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and cloud technologies. As a result, we intend to continue to spend significant resources maintaining, developing, and enhancing our technologies and platform&#59; however, these efforts may be more costly than expected and may not be successful.

Our ability to detect and combat fraudulent schemes, which have become increasingly common and sophisticated, could be adversely impacted by the adoption of new payment methods, the emergence and innovation of new technology platforms, including mobile and other devices, and our growth in certain regions, including in regions with a history of elevated fraudulent activity. We expect that technically-knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent our anti-fraud systems. In addition, the payment card networks have rules around acceptable chargeback ratios. If we are unable to effectively combat fictitious listings and fraudulent bookings on our platform, combat the use of fraudulent or stolen credit cards, or otherwise maintain or lower our current levels of charge-backs, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or be unable to continue to accept card payments because payment card networks have revoked our access to their networks, any of which would materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

We could be subject to significant fines or other enforcement actions if we are found to violate disclosure, reporting, anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, capitalization, fund management, corporate governance and internal controls, risk management, privacy, data protection and data localization, information security, banking secrecy, taxation, sanctions, or other laws and requirements, including those imposed on United Kingdom EMIs and Luxembourg payments institutions.

In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which is empowered to conduct rulemaking and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. We are subject to a number of such federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations, as well as related state consumer protection laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E as implemented by the CFPB. Money transmitters such as Airbnb Payments are subject to direct supervision and periodic examination by the CFPB and are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services, follow specified error resolution procedures, and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer, \n",

      "We could be subject to fines or other penalties if we are found to have violated the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s prohibition against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices or other consumer financial protection laws enforced by the CFPB or other agencies. The CFPB&#8217;s authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure. Additionally, technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties, including plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys&#8217; fees. The Dodd-Frank Act also empowers state attorneys general and other state officials to enforce federal consumer protection laws under specified conditions. Various government offices and agencies, including various state agencies and state attorneys general (as well as the CFPB and the U.S. Department of Justice), have the authority to conduct reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) involving us or our subsidiaries. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings could result in, among other things, substantial fines, penalties or changes in business practices that may require us to incur substantial costs. \n",

      "We provide payment services that may be subject to various U.S. state and federal privacy laws and regulations. Relevant federal privacy laws include the GLBA, which (along with its implementing regulations) restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. See our risk factor titled &#8220;&#8212; If we fail to comply with federal, state, and foreign laws relating to privacy and data protection, we may face potentially significant liability, negative publicity, an erosion of trust, and increased regulation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.&#8221; \n",

      "In addition to United Kingdom and Luxembourg payments-related consumer protection laws that are applicable to our business, regulators in European Union member states could notify APUK and APLux of local consumer protection laws that apply to our businesses, and could also seek to persuade the United Kingdom and Luxembourg regulators to order APUK or APLux to conduct their activities in the local country directly or through a branch office. These or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of, or delay, our plans to expand our business in European Union countries. \n",

      "\n",
      "We are subject to various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world, including the BSA. Among other things, the BSA requires money services businesses (including money transmitters such as Airbnb Payments) to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records. The BSA prohibits, among other things, our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities. In connection with and when required by regulatory requirements, we make information available to certain U.S. federal and state, as well as certain foreign, government agencies to assist in the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations. In certain circumstances, we may be required by government agencies to deny transactions that may be related to persons suspected of money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activities, and it is possible that we may inadvertently deny transactions from customers who are making legal money transfers. Regulators in the United States and globally may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions. In the European Union, the implementation of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (&#8220;MLD4&#8221;) may make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage, lead to increased friction for customers, and result in a decrease in business. Penalties for non-compliance with MLD4 could include fines of up to 10% of APUK&#8217;s or APLux&#8217;s total annual turnover. In April 2018, the European Parliament adopted the European Commission&#8217;s proposal for a Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (&#8220;MLD5&#8221;), containing more stringent provisions in certain areas, which will increase compliance costs. In July 2019, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) called on UK electronic money institutions to review their compliance with the requirements on safeguarding of customer funds and to notify the FCA in the event they identified any material non-compliance. APUK notified the FCA that it had identified gaps in its compliance and was undertaking remedial action. The FCA, in turn, appointed a third-party skilled person to perform a review of APUK&#8217;s safeguarding systems and controls, in accordance with Section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended) and all required actions identified by the skilled person were completed. The FCA closed the skilled persons review in August 2020. As part of its review, the skilled person also identified certain issues with APUK&#8217;s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing systems and controls. In August 2020, APUK submitted a gap analysis to the FCA of its compliance with the UK&#8217;s implementation of MLD4 and MLD5, which identified in-progress remedial action. To date, APUK has received no correspondence related to this gap analysis from the FCA. \n",

These economic and trade sanctions prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with certain specified countries, regions, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated, such as individuals and entities included on OFAC&#8217;s List of Specially Designated Nationals (&#8220;SDN List&#8221;), subject to EU&#47;UK asset freezes, or other sanctions measures. Any future economic and trade sanctions imposed in jurisdictions where we have significant business could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our ability to track and verify transactions and otherwise to comply with these regulations require a high level of internal controls. We maintain policies and procedures to implement these internal controls, which we periodically assess and update to the extent we identify compliance gaps.

The scope of this review included activity by users in certain countries and territories that were or are the target of U.S. sanctions laws. In July 2020, OFAC issued to us a cautionary letter and no administrative penalty with respect to certain aspects of that review concerning the Crimea region of Ukraine. The internal review also covered certain other issues concerning our compliance with OFAC&#8217;s sanctions program, focusing in particular on our business in Cuba, and as to our compliance with restrictions on transactions with specially designated nationals. We submitted the results of that internal review in final Voluntary Self Disclosures to OFAC in September 2020. In October 2020, OFAC issued to us cautionary letters and a no action letter, and no administrative penalties, with respect to the disclosed matters involving specially designated nationals. OFAC&#8217;s review of our voluntary self disclosure regarding Cuba is ongoing and we remain in close contact with OFAC. Depending upon OFAC&#8217;s assessment of the Cuba review, we could be subject to potentially significant monetary civil penalties and litigation, and our brand and reputation could be materially adversely affected. \n",

      "\n",
      "The loss of our credit and debit card acceptance privileges or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain card acceptance privileges would significantly limit our business model since a vast majority of our guests pay using credit or debit cards. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (the &#8220;PCI DSS&#8221;). Under the PCI DSS, we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use, storage, and transmission of card data to help prevent credit card fraud. If we fail to comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, including the PCI DSS, we would be in breach of our contractual obligations to payment processors and merchant banks. Such failure to comply may damage our relationship with payment card networks, subject us to restrictions, fines, penalties, damages, and civil liability, and could eventually prevent us from processing or accepting payment cards, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to comply with, or costly to implement. As a result, we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to make their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged. Further, there is no guarantee that, even if we comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, we will be able to maintain our payment card acceptance privileges. We also cannot guarantee that our compliance with network rules or the PCI DSS will prevent illegal or improper use of our payments platform or the theft, loss, or misuse of the credit card data of customers or participants, or a security breach. We are also required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, and other assessments of our compliance with the PCI DSS. If an audit, self-assessment, or other assessment indicates that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time-consuming remediation efforts, and we could lose our payment card acceptance privileges. \n",

Further, our ability to expand our payments activities into additional countries is dependent upon the third-party providers we use to support these activities. As we expand the availability of our payments activities to additional geographies or offer new payment methods to our hosts and guests in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements, and exposed to heightened fraud risk, which could lead to an increase in our operating expenses. \n",

Our payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us. Credit card transactions result in higher fees to us than transactions made through debit cards. Any material increase in interchange fees in the United States or other geographies, including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations imposed by law in some geographies, or other network fees or assessments, or a shift from payment with debit cards to credit cards could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

Accordingly, at any given time, we hold on behalf of our hosts and guests a substantial amount of funds, which are generally held in bank deposit accounts and in U.S. treasury bills and recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as funds receivable and amounts held on behalf of customers. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to either safeguard customer funds in bankruptcy-remote bank accounts, or hold such funds in eligible liquid assets, as defined by the relevant regulators in such jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount held on behalf of customers. Our ability to manage and account accurately for the cash underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls. As our business continues to grow and we expand our offerings and tiers, we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls. Our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds. Any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm, lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our platform and services, and result in significant penalties and fines from regulators, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

We also rely on such banks and financial institutions to help process payments transactions. We have both significant funds flows from and to various financial institutions as a result of our processing of payments from guests to hosts. As part of our currency hedging activities on these balances, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions. We regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and manage this exposure in an attempt to mitigate the associated risk. Despite these efforts, we may be exposed to the risk of default by, or deteriorating operating results or financial condition, or service interruptions at, or failure of, these counterparty financial institutions. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses or to access or recover our assets may be limited by the counterparty&#8217;s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, our ability to process payment transactions via such counterparties would be severely limited or cease.

In addition to using open source software, we also license to others some of our software through open source projects.

Because of the 20-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively continue to control a significant percentage of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until all such outstanding shares of Class B common stock have converted into shares of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, our founders, who collectively held 42.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2020, are party to a Voting Agreement under which each founder and his affiliates and certain other entities agree to vote their shares for the election of each individual founder to our board of directors. We and each of our founders are party to a Nominating Agreement under which we and the founders are required to take certain actions to include the founders in the slate of nominees nominated by our board of directors for the applicable class of directors, include them in our proxy statement, and solicit proxies or consents in favor of electing each founder to our board of directors. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.

      "Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes or transfers among our founders, if all of our founders agree to such transfers. Each share of our Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Class B holder into one share of Class A common stock. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. As a result, it is possible that one or more of the persons or entities holding our Class B common stock could gain significant voting control as other holders of Class B common stock sell or otherwise convert their shares into Class A common stock. In addition, the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. In addition, any future issuances of common stock would be dilutive to holders of Class A common stock. For example, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. Further, each outstanding share of Class H common stock will convert into a share of Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis upon the sale of such share of Class H common stock to any person or entity that is not our subsidiary, which would dilute holders of Class A common stock in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. \n",

For example, certain index providers, such as S&#38;P Dow Jones, have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indices, including the S&#38;P 500. Accordingly, the multi-series structure of our common stock would make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices may not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Because of the multi-class structure of our common stock, we will likely be excluded from certain indices and we cannot assure that other stock indices will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors.

      "The value of our marketable securities could decline, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our marketable securities portfolio includes various holdings, types, and maturities. Market values of these investments can be adversely impacted by various factors, including liquidity in the underlying security, credit deterioration, the financial condition of the credit issuer, foreign exchange rates, and changes in interest rates. Our marketable securities, which we consider highly-liquid investments, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&#8217; equity (deficit). Realized gains and losses and other than-temporary impairments are reported within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Our marketable equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the fair value of our marketable equity securities declines, our earnings will be reduced or losses will be increased. Furthermore, our interest income from cash, cash equivalents, and our marketable securities are impacted by changes in interest rates, and a decline in interest rates would adversely impact our interest income. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will incur significant expenses as a result of being a public company, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC, and the Listing Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;). Stockholder activism and the level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional significant compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. The increased costs will increase our net loss or decrease our net income, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase our service fees which could result in a reduction in bookings. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees, or as executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our Class A common stock, fines, sanctions, and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation. \n",

Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors.

      "As a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established by the SEC and Nasdaq. These rules and regulations will require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company are likely to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel, including senior management. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management&#8217;s initial certification under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will be required with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2021. In support of such certifications, we will be required to document and make significant changes and enhancements, including potentially hiring additional personnel, to our internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. As a result, we anticipate investing significant resources to enhance and maintain our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems, and procedures. \n",
      "\n",
      "To date, neither our management nor an independent registered public accounting firm has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because no such evaluation has been required. If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we identify or fail to remediate material weaknesses in our internal controls, or we do not effectively or accurately report our financial performance to the appropriate regulators on a timely basis, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of investor confidence, which could significantly harm our reputation and our stock price, and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \n",

      "We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with a revision to previously issued financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to the provision for income taxes resulting from the incorrect use of tax attributes. We identified that the cause of the income tax provision adjustment was a lack of qualified tax personnel with an appropriate level of experience to review the use of tax attributes in accordance with tax ordering rules. While we remediated this material weakness as of December 31, 2018 through hiring additional experienced personnel, we can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased probability of fraud, the potential loss of customers, litigation from our stockholders, reduction in our ability to obtain financing, and require additional expenditures to remediate. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and a decline in our stock price, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. \n",

System implementations of this scale are complex and time-consuming projects that require transformations of business and financial processes. Such transformations involve risk inherent in the conversion to a new system, including loss of information and potential disruption to normal operations. Additionally, if our revenue and other accounting or tax systems do not operate as intended or do not scale with anticipated growth in our business, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected. Any failure to develop, implement, or maintain effective internal controls related to our revenue and other accounting or tax systems and associated reporting could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, if we experience interruptions in service or operational difficulties with our revenue and other accounting or tax systems, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n",

Adoption of a change in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the adoption of such change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles and accounting policies over financial reporting, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could require significant investment in systems and personnel. \n",
